---

### 3. ✅ RESOLVED: Volume Fade Curve Implementation

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Complete mathematical formulas and implementation algorithms added to crossfade.md section "Volume Fade Curve Formulas":

**Specifications added:**
- **[XFD-IMPL-080 to 086]:** Mathematical formulas for all six fade curve types
  - **Fade-In curves:** Linear `v(t) = t`, Exponential `v(t) = t²`, Cosine `v(t) = 0.5 × (1 - cos(π × t))`
  - **Fade-Out curves:** Linear `v(t) = 1.0 - t`, Logarithmic `v(t) = (1.0 - t)²`, Cosine `v(t) = 0.5 × (1 + cos(π × t))`
  - All formulas use normalized time `t ∈ [0.0, 1.0]`
  - Output volume multiplier `v ∈ [0.0, 1.0]` (fade-in) or `v ∈ [1.0, 0.0]` (fade-out)

- **[XFD-IMPL-090]:** Normalized time calculation
  - Fade-in: `t_fade_in = (current_time - start_time) / fade_in_duration`
  - Fade-out: `t_fade_out = (current_time - fade_out_point) / fade_out_duration`
  - Both clamped to [0.0, 1.0]

- **[XFD-IMPL-100]:** Complete volume calculation function
  - `calculate_passage_volume(passage, current_time)` pseudocode
  - Applies fade-in if in fade-in region
  - Applies fade-out if in fade-out region
  - Multiplies both factors (independent fade operations)

- **[XFD-IMPL-110]:** Crossfade mixing formula
  - `final_output = (audio_a × volume_a) + (audio_b × volume_b)`
  - Resume-from-pause ramp applied after mixing
  - Master volume applied last

- **[XFD-IMPL-120]:** Crossfade update rate: 50ms intervals (20 Hz) for smooth transitions

**Documentation location:** crossfade.md:294-444 (subsection "Volume Fade Curve Formulas")

**Implementation notes:**
- Fade curve symmetry: Exponential fade-in pairs with logarithmic fade-out for perceptually balanced crossfades
- Zero-duration fades handled by setting volume directly without interpolation

- **[ARCH-QUEUE-PERSIST-020]**: Playback position persisted only on clean shutdown
- **[ARCH-QUEUE-PERSIST-030]**: Comprehensive database backup strategy with atomic operations, periodic backup (3 months), startup integrity checks, and network fallback

**Details added:**
- Single database design (queue with library data)
- Playback position transmitted via SSE at configurable interval (`playback_progress_interval_ms`, default 5000ms)
- Position automatically reset to 0 on queue changes (natural crash recovery)
- Backup retention: 3 timestamped backups, minimum 2-week interval between startup backups

---

### 5. ✅ RESOLVED: Audio Device Selection API

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Complete audio device enumeration and selection API specified:

**API Endpoints Added:**
- **GET /audio/devices** (api_design.md:651-683):
  - Lists available audio output devices
  - Returns array of `{id, name, default}` objects
  - Always includes `"default"` as first option (system default)
  - Error: `no_devices_found` if no devices available

- **POST /audio/device** (api_design.md:685-710):
  - Set audio output device by ID
  - Request: `{"device_id": "pulse-sink-1"}`
  - Response: `{"status": "ok", "device_id": "...", "device_name": "..."}`
  - Errors: `device_not_found`, `device_unavailable`
  - Seamless device switching during playback
  - Persists selection in settings table (`audio_output_device` key)

**Device Identifier Format Specified:**
- **Platform-specific formats** (api_design.md:670-675, gstreamer_design.md:816-826):
  - Linux (PulseAudio): `pulse-sink-N` (e.g., `pulse-sink-0`)
  - Linux (ALSA): `alsa-hw-N-M` (e.g., `alsa-hw-0-0`)
  - macOS (CoreAudio): `coreaudio-UID` (e.g., `coreaudio-AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,0:0`)
  - Windows (WASAPI): `wasapi-{GUID}`
  - Special: `default` (system default output)

**Implementation Details Added** (gstreamer_design.md:812-1041):
- **[GST-DEV-005 to 006]:** Device identifier construction from GStreamer DeviceMonitor
- **[GST-DEV-010 to 015]:** Device enumeration using GStreamer DeviceMonitor API
- **[GST-DEV-020 to 030]:** Device selection with runtime audiosink replacement
- **[GST-DEV-040 to 080]:** Platform-specific considerations:
  - PulseAudio: Hot-plugging support, device IDs may change across reboots
  - ALSA: Direct hardware access, stable device numbers, exclusive access required
  - CoreAudio: Stable UIDs, automatic device switching
  - WASAPI: Persistent GUIDs, shared mode audio

**Documentation locations:**
- api_design.md:651-710 (complete API specification)
- gstreamer_design.md:812-1041 (Section 10: Audio Device Enumeration)

### 6. ✅ RESOLVED: SSE Event Payload Formats

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Complete SSE event JSON wire formats added to api_design.md with comprehensive documentation.

**Documentation Added** (api_design.md:836-1044):

New section "SSE Event Formats" with complete specifications for all 7 Audio Player events:

1. **PlaybackProgress** (api_design.md:842-866):
   - Fields: `passage_id`, `position_ms`, `duration_ms`, `timestamp`
   - SSE wire format example and JSON structure
   - Emission timing notes (configurable interval, Pause/Play triggers)

2. **VolumeChanged** (api_design.md:868-892):
   - Fields: `old_volume` (float 0.0-1.0), `new_volume` (float 0.0-1.0), `timestamp`
   - System-level volume scale (0.0-1.0) used in SSE for precision
   - Conversion formula to user display scale (0-100 integer)

3. **QueueChanged** (api_design.md:894-924):
   - Fields: `queue` (array of passage UUIDs), `trigger`, `timestamp`
   - Trigger values: `user_enqueue`, `program_director`, `user_dequeue`, `passage_completed`, `queue_cleared`, `queue_reordered`

4. **PlaybackStateChanged** (api_design.md:926-948):
   - Fields: `old_state`, `new_state`, `timestamp`
   - State values: `"playing"`, `"paused"`

5. **PassageStarted** (api_design.md:950-976):
   - Fields: `passage_id`, `file_path`, `start_time_ms`, `end_time_ms`, `timestamp`

6. **PassageCompleted** (api_design.md:978-1008):
   - Fields: `passage_id`, `completed` (boolean), `reason`, `timestamp`
   - Reason values: `natural`, `user_skip`, `playback_error`, `queue_removed`

7. **CurrentSongChanged** (api_design.md:1010-1043):
   - Fields: `passage_id`, `song_id` (nullable), `song_albums`, `position_ms`, `timestamp`
   - Use cases: album art updates, now playing display

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Volume Scale:** SSE uses system-level 0.0-1.0 (float) rather than user-facing 0-100 (integer) for precision in real-time streams
- **Timestamps:** All events include ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
- **Wire Format:** Standard SSE format with `event:` and `data:` lines, data contains JSON
- **Trigger Semantics:** QueueChanged includes trigger field to distinguish user actions from automatic operations

**Cross-References:**
- event_system.md defines Rust event types (internal representation)
- api_design.md defines JSON wire formats (external SSE protocol)
- Conversion between internal (u8 0-100) and SSE (f64 0.0-1.0) handled by serialization layer

---

### 7. ✅ RESOLVED: Error Recovery Strategies

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Comprehensive error recovery strategies added to architecture.md with detailed procedures for all error scenarios.

**Documentation Added** (architecture.md:1019-1155):

New subsection "Error Recovery Strategies" with complete specifications:

#### **GStreamer Pipeline Errors** (ARCH-ERR-PLAYBACK-010 to 030):

**[ARCH-ERR-PLAYBACK-010]** Pipeline Error Recovery:
1. Log error with pipeline state and details
2. Handle as skip event:
   - Emit `PassageCompleted(completed=false)` with reason (`playback_error` or `queue_removed`)
   - Remove failed passage from queue
3. Advance to next passage:
   - If crossfade in progress: Continue from current position
   - If not yet started: Begin from beginning
   - Fade-in curve unaffected (continues normally)
4. Continue until queue exhausted:
   - Multiple failures continue to skip passages
   - Empty queue: Enter idle state (same as normal empty queue)

**[ARCH-ERR-PLAYBACK-020]** Crossfade Behavior:
- Error during crossfade: Failed pipeline stops, surviving pipeline continues
- Error during pre-load: Current pipeline unaffected, skip logic applies on completion

**[ARCH-ERR-PLAYBACK-030]** Automatic Queue Refill Throttling:
- wkmp-pd monitors failures and stops enqueueing after threshold (3 failures in 60s, configurable)
- Requires manual intervention to resume

#### **Database Lock Timeout** (ARCH-ERR-DB-010 to 030):

**[ARCH-ERR-DB-010]** Retry Strategy:
- Exponential backoff: 10ms, 20ms, 40ms, 80ms, 160ms, 320ms, 640ms
- Maximum 7 retries (8 total attempts)
- Total max wait: 1,270ms
- If all fail: Log error, continue with cached state (or return error for critical ops)

**[ARCH-ERR-DB-020]** Cached State Fallback:
- Can use cache: Queue read, settings read, module config read
- Cannot use cache: Queue write, settings write (must succeed or error)

**[ARCH-ERR-DB-030]** Lock Configuration:
- SQLite busy timeout: 5000ms at connection initialization
- Exponential backoff provides additional resilience

#### **Program Director Timeout** (ARCH-ERR-PD-010 to 040):

**[ARCH-ERR-PD-010]** Timeout Handling:
1. Timeout detection: `queue_refill_acknowledgment_timeout_seconds` (default 5s)
2. Log warning with request details
3. Continue playback with existing queue
4. Retry on next threshold trigger (fresh timeout timer)

**[ARCH-ERR-PD-020]** Request Throttling:
- Minimum interval: `queue_refill_request_throttle_seconds` (default 10s)
- Prevents request spam during unavailability

**[ARCH-ERR-PD-030]** Empty Queue Behavior:
- Enter idle state, continue attempting refill at throttle interval
- Resume playback automatically when wkmp-pd responds

**[ARCH-ERR-PD-040]** Module Health Monitoring:
- wkmp-ui responsible for detecting and relaunching unresponsive modules
- wkmp-ap only logs timeouts and continues operation

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **No degraded mode:** System continues operating normally through errors, skipping failures
- **Graceful degradation:** Playback continues with existing queue when Program Director unavailable
- **Clear responsibility separation:** wkmp-ap handles errors, wkmp-ui handles module health
- **Configurable thresholds:** All timeout and retry values configurable in settings table
- **Consistent skip behavior:** All playback failures treated as skip events for predictable UX

**Documentation location:** architecture.md:1019-1155 (Error Recovery Strategies subsection)

---

### 8. ✅ RESOLVED: CurrentSongChanged Event Trigger Logic

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Complete song boundary detection and CurrentSongChanged event emission logic added to architecture.md.

**Documentation Added** (architecture.md:239-316):

New section "Song Boundary Detection (CurrentSongChanged Event)" with complete specifications:

#### **Passage vs Song Relationship** ([ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-010]):

**Key clarifications:**
- **Passage:** Continuous subset of audio file from `start_time_ms` to `end_time_ms`
- Passages play continuously without transitions except at start/end
- Multiple passages can exist within single audio file (may overlap or have gaps)
- Same audio region can play in both lead-out and lead-in of consecutive passages
- Each passage contains zero or more songs (defined in `passage_songs` table)

#### **Song Timeline Construction** ([ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-020]):

**On passage start:**
1. Query `passage_songs` table: `SELECT * FROM passage_songs WHERE passage_id = ? ORDER BY start_time`
2. Build song timeline in memory: `{song_id, start_time_ms, end_time_ms, albums[]}`
3. Store timeline for duration of passage playback
4. Timeline remains valid until passage completes (no dynamic updates)

**Note:** `passage_songs` table also called "cut list" in music production

#### **CurrentSongChanged Emission** ([ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-030 to 060]):

**[ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-030]** Detection mechanism:
1. **Position monitoring:** Check position against song timeline every 500ms
   - Separate timer from `PlaybackProgress` (which uses configurable interval)
   - Uses same position query mechanism as PlaybackProgress
2. **Boundary detection:** Compare `current_position_ms` to each song's time range
3. **Event emission:** When position crosses boundaries (song→song, song→gap, gap→song)
4. **Event payload:** `{passage_id, song_id (Option), song_albums, position_ms, timestamp}`
5. **Gap handling:** If position not within any song: `song_id = None`

**[ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-040]** Implementation:
- Song timeline built only once per passage (on PassageStarted)
- No periodic re-reading of database during playback
- Simple time range comparisons (no complex state machine)
- 500ms interval balances smooth UI updates with CPU efficiency
- First CurrentSongChanged emitted immediately on passage start (if in song)

**[ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-050]** Edge cases:
- Passage with no songs: Emit with `song_id=None` on start
- Passage starts in gap: Emit `None`, then emit again when entering song
- Passage ends during song: PassageCompleted marks end (no special handling)
- Songs with identical boundaries: First song chosen (or multiple events)
- Seeking: Immediately check position and emit if song changed

**[ARCH-SONG-CHANGE-060]** Performance:
- Song timeline in memory (typically <100 songs, minimal impact)
- O(n) boundary checks (acceptable for typical passage sizes)
- Large passages (>1000 songs): Consider binary search on sorted timeline
- Detection timer runs only during playback (paused = no checks)

**Documentation location:** architecture.md:239-316 (Song Boundary Detection section)

---

### 9. ✅ RESOLVED: Initial State After Crash/Power Loss

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Fully specified in architecture.md:195-208 and requirements.md:426-431:
- **[ARCH-STARTUP-005]**: `initial_play_state` setting ("playing" or "paused", default "playing")
- **[ARCH-STARTUP-010]**: Complete cold start procedure
- **[REQ-PB-050-055]**: Initial play state configuration requirements

**Key clarifications:**
- Current playback state never persisted
- Always resumes to configured `initial_play_state`
- `last_played_position` reset to 0 on queue changes (natural crash recovery)
- Queue entries validated lazily on playback attempt
- Resume from position only if clean shutdown AND no queue changes

---

### 10. ✅ RESOLVED: HTTP Server Configuration

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Comprehensive HTTP server configuration added to deployment.md section 13:

**Key specifications added:**
- **[DEP-HTTP-020 to 060]**: Port configuration with base+offset system
  - Base ports: `[5720, 15720, 25720, 17200, 23400]` in settings table
  - Module offsets: ui=0, ap=1, pd=2, ai=3, le=4
  - Intelligent port selection: tries last successful port first, then fallbacks
  - Duplicate instance detection via `GET /health` identity check
  - Port persistence in `module_config.port` prevents unnecessary port hopping

- **[DEP-HTTP-090 to 110]**: Bind address configuration
  - wkmp-ui defaults to `0.0.0.0` (network accessible)
  - All other modules default to `127.0.0.1` (localhost-only)
  - Configurable per-module via `module_config.host`

- **[DEP-HTTP-120 to 130]**: Timeouts
  - Request timeout: 30 seconds
  - Keepalive timeout: 60 seconds

- **[DEP-HTTP-140 to 150]**: Request body limits
  - Maximum: 1 MB (1,048,576 bytes)
  - Exceeds limit: HTTP 413 response

- **[DEP-HTTP-160 to 200]**: CORS configuration
  - Disabled on all modules except wkmp-le
  - wkmp-le enables CORS for lyric editor workflow (external website access)

- **[DEP-HTTP-240]**: Settings table additions
  - `http_base_ports`, `http_request_timeout_ms`, `http_keepalive_timeout_ms`, `http_max_body_size_bytes`

**Documentation locations:**
- deployment.md:703-935 (comprehensive section)
- database_schema.md:741-752 (settings table reference)

---

### 11. ✅ RESOLVED: PlaybackProgress Event Frequency

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Fully specified:
- event_system.md:176-193: Configurable interval via `playback_progress_interval_ms` setting (default: 5000ms)
- database_schema.md:713: Setting documented with default value
- api_design.md:769: SSE event note updated
- Wall-clock time based, emitted during Playing state + once on Pause/Play transitions

---

### 12. ✅ RESOLVED: Passage Pre-loading Strategy

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Pre-loading strategy fully specified in both crossfade.md and gstreamer_design.md:

**Specifications added:**
- **[XFD-IMPL-050 to 070]** (crossfade.md): Pre-loading trigger calculation
  - Pre-load buffer time: 5.0 seconds before crossfade starts
  - Trigger point: `passage_b_start_time - preload_buffer_time`
  - Idle pipeline loaded and transitioned to PAUSED state (buffered and ready)
  - Prevents audio glitches during crossfade transition

- **gstreamer_design.md Section 5:** Complete pre-loading implementation
  - Pipeline state transitions: NULL → READY → PAUSED (buffered)
  - Pipeline A plays while Pipeline B pre-loads in background
  - When pre-load complete, Pipeline B ready for seamless crossfade
  - Crossfade execution: Both pipelines in PLAYING state, audiomixer combines streams

- **gstreamer_design.md Section 8:** Error handling for pre-load failures
  - File not found: Log error, emit PassageCompleted(completed=false), advance to next
  - Decode error: Same recovery path (skip to next passage)
  - Bus message monitoring detects all pipeline errors

- **gstreamer_design.md Section 11:** Memory management
  - Only one passage pre-loaded at a time (current + next)
  - Buffer sizing: GStreamer default buffering (typically 2 seconds decoded audio per pipeline)
  - Total memory: ~10-20 MB for dual pipeline operation (platform-dependent)

**Documentation locations:**
- crossfade.md:273-292 (Pre-loading Strategy subsection)
- gstreamer_design.md:Section 5 (Crossfade Implementation)
- gstreamer_design.md:Section 8 (Error Handling)
- gstreamer_design.md:Section 11 (Buffer Management)

## 🟡 AMBIGUITIES (Should Clarify)

### 13. ✅ RESOLVED: Queue "play_order" Gap Strategy

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Fully specified in database_schema.md:551-569 and architecture.md:225-237:
- Append: `play_order = last_play_order + 10`
- Gaps enable insertion without renumbering
- Overflow protection: Auto-renumber at 2,000,000,000 (1,225 years at normal usage)
- API accepts UUID-based insert positions that translate to play_order internally

---

### 14. ✅ RESOLVED: Volume Scale (0-100 vs 0.0-1.0)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-10)

**Resolution:** Standardized across all documents:
- **User-facing** (UI, API): Integer 0-100
- **Backend** (storage, GStreamer): Double 0.0-1.0
- **Conversion**:
  - User → System: `system_volume = user_volume / 100.0`
  - System → User: `user_volume = ceil(system_volume * 100.0)`
- Documented in: architecture.md:239-252, database_schema.md:711, api_design.md:654-670, event_system.md:195-204

---

### 15. AMBIGUITY: Skip vs PassageCompleted

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

**Location:** event_system.md, api_design.md

**Issue:** No API endpoint for explicit "Skip" command defined.
- Is skip implemented as immediate advance to next passage?
- Does it emit PassageCompleted(completed=false)?
- Or is there a separate Skip endpoint?

**Progress:** requirements.md:363 defines REQ-CTL-030 "Skip: Move to next passage in queue" but API not specified.

**Recommendation:** Add to api_design.md:
```markdown
#### `POST /playback/skip`
Skip currently playing passage and advance to next in queue.

**Response:**
```json
{"status": "ok", "next_passage_id": "uuid-or-null"}
```

**Behavior:**
1. Emit PassageCompleted(completed=false) for current passage
2. Remove current passage from queue
3. Begin playback of next passage (if available and in Playing state)
4. If queue becomes empty, wait according to play state

**Errors:**
- `no_passage_playing`: Nothing currently playing to skip
```

---

### 16. AMBIGUITY: Pause During Crossfade

**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Location:** crossfade.md:XFD-EDGE-040 (line 458)

**Issue:** Says "Pause takes effect immediately" but:
- Are both pipelines paused?
- Does crossfade resume where it left off?
- What about the fade-in-from-pause behavior?

**Recommendation:** Clarify in crossfade.md:
```markdown
**[XFD-EDGE-041]** Pause During Crossfade Behavior:
- Both pipelines paused immediately
- Crossfade state preserved (elapsed time, volume levels)
- On resume (Play):
  - Apply 0.5s exponential fade-in to both pipelines from their paused levels
  - Continue crossfade from where it left off
  - Crossfade completes normally after resume
```

---

### 17. AMBIGUITY: Developer UI Scope

**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Location:** architecture.md:115-118

**Issue:** "Minimal HTML/JavaScript served via HTTP" but:
- What routes (/, /status, /events)?
- Is this production code or debug-only?
- Should it be compiled out for Minimal version?

**Recommendation:** Clarify scope:
```markdown
**[ARCH-DEVUI-010]** Developer UI:
- Routes: GET / (status dashboard), GET /events (SSE monitor)
- Purpose: Debug/development only (not production feature)
- Versions: Full and Lite only (excluded from Minimal)
- Security: Localhost-only access (no remote access)
```

---

### 18. AMBIGUITY: "NULL = use global" Semantics

**Status:** ✅ CLARIFIED (Existing documentation sufficient)

**Location:** database_schema.md:138-144, crossfade.md:255-264

**Current state:** crossfade.md:XFD-DEF-030 specifies:
- NULL values remain NULL in storage
- Resolved dynamically at playback time when both passages known
- Global Crossfade Time applied with 50% clamping if needed
- User-defined (non-NULL) timing points never modified

**Assessment:** Adequately specified, no changes needed.

---

### 19. AMBIGUITY: Queue Removal During Playback

**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Location:** api_design.md:730

**Issue:** DELETE /playback/queue/{passage_id} - what if passage is currently playing?
- Does it stop immediately?
- Skip to next?
- Return error?

**Recommendation:** Clarify in api_design.md:
```markdown
#### `DELETE /playback/queue/{passage_id}`
Remove passage from queue.

**Behavior:**
- If passage is not currently playing: Remove from queue, return success
- If passage is currently playing:
  1. Remove from queue
  2. Stop current playback
  3. Emit PassageCompleted(completed=false)
  4. Advance to next passage (if available and in Playing state)

**Response:**
```json
{"status": "ok", "was_playing": true}
```
```

### 20. AMBIGUITY: Module Restart/Relaunch Ownership

**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED

**Location:** database_schema.md:733-735

**Issue:** Settings mention "relaunch" but:
- Which module is responsible for relaunching failed modules?
- Is there a supervisor process?
- Or does each module self-restart?

**Recommendation:** Clarify in architecture.md or deployment.md:
```markdown
**[ARCH-SUPERVISOR-010]** Module Supervision:
- No built-in supervisor process
- System-level supervision via systemd (Linux) or equivalent
- Settings relaunch_delay and relaunch_attempts are for future use
- Phase 1: Manual restart required
- Phase 2: Consider systemd watchdog or custom supervisor
```

1. **Create GStreamer Technical Design** (addresses Gap #1) ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Pipeline architecture diagram
   - Element selection and configuration
   - State transition logic
   - Bin structure for crossfade

2. **Add Crossfade Implementation Algorithms** (addresses Gaps #2, #3, #12) ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Timing calculation pseudocode
   - Volume fade formulas with mathematical definitions
   - Pre-load strategy with timing triggers
   - Case detection logic (C1/C2/C3)

3. **Complete API Specifications** (addresses Gaps #5, #6, #15) ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   - GET /audio/devices endpoint
   - POST /playback/skip endpoint
   - SSE event JSON payloads (all event types)
   - Error response structures

4. **Define Error Recovery** (addresses Gap #7) ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   - GStreamer error handling with degraded mode
   - Database retry logic with backoff
   - Program Director timeout handling

5. **Specify CurrentSongChanged Logic** (addresses Gap #8) ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Song timeline construction
   - Boundary detection algorithm
   - Gap handling

6. ~~**HTTP Server Configuration**~~ ✅ RESOLVED (Gap #10)
   - Port selection with base+offset system
   - Duplicate instance detection
   - Bind address defaults and configuration
   - Timeout values and body size limits
   - CORS policy per module

### Medium Priority (Can Define During Implementation):

7. **Resolve Remaining Ambiguities** (addresses items #15-#17, #19-#20)
   - Pause during crossfade behavior
   - Developer UI scope
   - Queue removal during playback
   - Module supervision strategy

8. **Add Performance Specifications**
   - SSE broadcast throttling
   - Memory limits for dual pipeline
   - Database connection pooling

9. **Platform-Specific Details**
