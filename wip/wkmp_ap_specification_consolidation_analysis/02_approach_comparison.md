# Implementation Approach Comparison

**Section:** Detailed comparison of approaches for proceeding to implementation
**Parent Document:** [00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md)

---

## Purpose

This document compares three approaches for organizing wkmp-ap specifications to enable /plan workflow execution and subsequent implementation.

---

## Background

**Original Request:** Create SPEC023-wkmp_ap_consolidated_implementation.md

**Analysis Finding:** All critical gaps resolved; existing SPEC documents comprehensively cover wkmp-ap design

**Question:** Should we create SPEC023 (redundant consolidation) or use existing specifications differently?

---

## APPROACH 1: Use Existing Specifications As-Is

### Description

Invoke /plan workflow multiple times (once per relevant SPEC document) and manually integrate results into cohesive implementation plan.

**Relevant Specifications:**
- SPEC002-crossfade.md (crossfade timing, curves, state machine)
- SPEC013-single_stream_playback.md (high-level architecture)
- SPEC016-decoder_buffer_design.md (authoritative pipeline specification)
- SPEC017-sample_rate_conversion.md (tick-based timing)
- SPEC018-crossfade_completion_coordination.md (queue advancement)
- SPEC021-error_handling.md (error taxonomy and handling)
- SPEC022-performance_targets.md (quantified targets)

**Workflow:**
1. Run `/plan SPEC002` → Generate implementation plan for crossfade
2. Run `/plan SPEC016` → Generate implementation plan for decoder-buffer pipeline
3. Run `/plan SPEC017` → Generate implementation plan for sample rate conversion
4. Run `/plan SPEC018` → Generate implementation plan for crossfade completion
5. Run `/plan SPEC021` → Generate implementation plan for error handling
6. Manually integrate all plans into unified implementation order
7. Resolve dependencies and overlaps between plans
8. Create unified test suite

### Risk Assessment

**Failure Risk:** LOW

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Integration gaps between separately-planned specifications**
   - Probability: Low
   - Impact: Medium
   - Details: Each SPEC generates its own increment plan; dependencies across specs may be missed
   - Example: SPEC016 decode logic depends on SPEC021 error handling, but separate plans may not coordinate error integration

2. **Requirement ID conflicts across documents**
   - Probability: Low
   - Impact: Low
   - Details: GOV002 enumeration scheme uses DOC-CAT-NNN format with document-specific prefixes
   - Mitigation: Scheme designed to prevent conflicts (XFD-### vs DBD-### vs ERH-###)

3. **Duplicate test cases across plans**
   - Probability: Medium
   - Impact: Low
   - Details: Multiple specs may specify tests for same functionality
   - Example: SPEC002 and SPEC018 both test crossfade completion
   - Mitigation: Manual deduplication during integration

4. **Missed cross-cutting concerns**
   - Probability: Low
   - Impact: Medium
   - Details: Concerns spanning multiple specs (logging, events) may lack coordination
   - Mitigation: SPEC011 event system and IMPL002 coding conventions provide cross-cutting standards

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Review all SPEC documents for cross-references before planning
- Create dependency matrix showing SPEC relationships
- Use common event system (SPEC011) and coding conventions (IMPL002)
- Deduplicate test cases during manual integration

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW

### Quality Characteristics

**Maintainability: HIGH**
- Each SPEC remains independently editable
- Changes to one SPEC don't require updating consolidated document
- Clear separation of concerns (crossfade vs decoder vs error handling)
- Follows WKMP documentation hierarchy (no redundancy)

**Test Coverage Achievable: HIGH**
- Each SPEC generates its own comprehensive test suite
- May have duplicate tests (requires deduplication)
- Complete coverage of all requirements

**Architectural Alignment: STRONG**
- Follows GOV001 tier structure precisely
- No new tier-2 documents created
- Respects DRY principle (no duplication across specifications)
- Correct information flow (tier 2 → tier 3 → tier 4)

### Implementation Considerations

**Effort:**
- Upfront: LOW (no document creation, immediate /plan invocation)
- Per-use: MEDIUM (7 separate /plan invocations + manual integration)
- Total estimated: 12-16 hours (7 × 1.5 hours /plan + 4 hours integration)

**Dependencies:**
- All SPEC documents must exist (✅ all exist)
- SPEC021 should be approved (⚠️ currently Draft)
- Developer must understand relationships between specs

**Complexity: LOW**
- Straightforward process (run /plan, integrate)
- No new concepts or documents
- Standard WKMP workflow

### Advantages

✅ Lowest upfront effort (no document creation)
✅ Follows WKMP documentation standards precisely
✅ No redundancy or DRY violations
✅ Each SPEC independently maintainable
✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Disadvantages

❌ Requires manual integration of 7 separate plans
❌ Risk of integration gaps (low probability but nonzero)
❌ No single orchestration point for wkmp-ap implementation
❌ May produce duplicate test cases requiring deduplication

---

## APPROACH 2: Create SPEC023 Consolidated Integration Specification

### Description

Create new tier-2 specification document (SPEC023-wkmp_ap_consolidated_implementation.md) that consolidates references to existing specifications, documents integration points, and provides unified orchestration.

**SPEC023 Content:**
1. Overview of wkmp-ap implementation scope
2. References to all relevant SPEC documents (SPEC002, SPEC016, SPEC017, SPEC018, SPEC021, SPEC022)
3. Integration requirements (how specs interact)
4. At-risk decisions documentation
5. Requirement priority ordering
6. Unified requirement ID namespace (WAPI-### for "wkmp-ap implementation")

**Workflow:**
1. Create SPEC023 (4-6 hours)
2. Run `/plan SPEC023` → Generate unified implementation plan
3. Implement per plan
4. Maintain SPEC023 when source specs change

### Risk Assessment

**Failure Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Redundancy with existing specifications**
   - Probability: MEDIUM
   - Impact: LOW
   - Details: SPEC023 may duplicate content from SPEC002, SPEC016, etc.
   - Consequence: Violates DRY principle; maintenance burden

2. **SPEC023 becomes outdated when referenced specs evolve**
   - Probability: MEDIUM
   - Impact: MEDIUM
   - Details: When SPEC002 changes, SPEC023 must be updated to reflect changes
   - Consequence: Synchronization overhead; risk of inconsistency

3. **Integration gaps despite consolidation**
   - Probability: LOW
   - Impact: LOW
   - Details: SPEC023 may still miss integration points between source specs
   - Mitigation: Thorough review of all source specs during SPEC023 creation

4. **Incorrect tier placement**
   - Probability: HIGH
   - Impact: LOW
   - Details: Per GOV001, tier 2 = "HOW requirements satisfied" (design); "WHEN to build" belongs at EXEC tier
   - Consequence: Architectural misalignment with documentation hierarchy

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep SPEC023 minimal (links + integration only, no duplication)
- Establish synchronization process (update SPEC023 when source specs change)
- Document SPEC023 as "integration orchestration" not full specification

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW-MEDIUM (synchronization overhead remains)

### Quality Characteristics

**Maintainability: MEDIUM**
- Requires synchronization with 7 source specifications
- Changes to any source spec may require SPEC023 update
- Risk of SPEC023 becoming outdated
- Adds maintenance burden to specification workflow

**Test Coverage Achievable: HIGH**
- Single /plan invocation produces unified test suite
- Can define integration tests explicitly in SPEC023
- No duplicate tests (unified source)

**Architectural Alignment: MODERATE**
- Adds tier-2 document (acceptable per GOV001)
- Purpose is integration (borderline tier-2/tier-4)
- Some redundancy with source specs (DRY violation risk)
- May be more appropriate as GUIDE/EXEC document

### Implementation Considerations

**Effort:**
- Upfront: MEDIUM (4-6 hours to create SPEC023)
- Per-use: LOW (single /plan invocation)
- Maintenance: MEDIUM (synchronization with source specs)
- Total estimated: 8-10 hours (6 hours creation + 2 hours /plan + ongoing maintenance)

**Dependencies:**
- All source SPEC documents
- SPEC021 approval recommended
- Synchronization process established

**Complexity: MEDIUM**
- Creating SPEC023 requires deep understanding of all source specs
- Must identify integration points accurately
- Must establish synchronization workflow

### Advantages

✅ Single orchestration point for wkmp-ap implementation
✅ Explicit integration requirements
✅ At-risk decisions documented in one place
✅ Single /plan invocation (simpler workflow)
✅ Can define integration tests explicitly

### Disadvantages

❌ Violates DRY principle (redundancy with source specs)
❌ Synchronization overhead (must update when sources change)
❌ Risk of becoming outdated
❌ Borderline incorrect tier placement (integration = EXEC, not SPEC)
❌ Medium upfront effort for questionable value
❌ Adds maintenance burden to specification workflow

## APPROACH 3: Create GUIDE002 Implementation Guide (EXEC Tier)

### Description

Create implementation guide at EXEC tier (similar to existing GUIDE001-wkmp_ap_implementation_plan.md) that orchestrates implementation across all SPEC documents without duplicating their content.

**GUIDE002 Content:**
1. **Specification Inventory:** List of all relevant SPEC documents with purpose
2. **Implementation Scope:** What's included in wkmp-ap re-implementation
3. **Specification Dependencies:** How specs relate to each other
4. **Implementation Phases:** Proposed increment order with rationale
5. **At-Risk Decisions:** Documented assumptions and risks
6. **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Error handling, events, logging integration
7. **Test Strategy:** How tests from multiple specs integrate
8. **Acceptance Criteria:** Definition of "done" for wkmp-ap implementation

**Workflow:**
1. Create GUIDE002 (4-6 hours)
2. Use GUIDE002 as orchestration document
3. Run `/plan` for each SPEC referenced in GUIDE002 phases
4. Integrate per GUIDE002 increment order
5. Validate against GUIDE002 acceptance criteria

### Risk Assessment

**Failure Risk:** LOW

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Guide becomes inconsistent with source specs**
   - Probability: MEDIUM
   - Impact: LOW
   - Details: When SPEC002 changes, GUIDE002 references may become outdated
   - Mitigation: GUIDE002 only references, doesn't duplicate; updates minimal

2. **Integration guidance insufficient**
   - Probability: LOW
   - Impact: MEDIUM
   - Details: Guide may not provide enough detail for integration
   - Mitigation: Detailed dependency analysis during guide creation

3. **Incorrect tier placement assumption**
   - Probability: LOW
   - Impact: LOW
   - Details: Assuming GUIDE/EXEC tier is correct
   - Verification: GOV001 tier definitions support this (EXEC = "WHEN to build")

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Treat GUIDE002 as living document (update with spec changes)
- Detailed dependency analysis upfront
- Regular synchronization checks

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW

### Quality Characteristics

**Maintainability: MEDIUM**
- Requires updates as specs evolve (similar to SPEC023)
- But updates less frequent (only references, not content duplication)
- Living document expected at EXEC tier
- Precedent: GUIDE001 exists and is maintained

**Test Coverage Achievable: HIGH**
- Aggregates test requirements from all source specs
- Defines integration test strategy
- Clear acceptance criteria

**Architectural Alignment: STRONG**
- Correct tier placement per GOV001 (EXEC tier = "WHEN to build features")
- GUIDE/EXEC tier purpose: "Implementation phases and dependencies"
- Precedent: GUIDE001-wkmp_ap_implementation_plan.md already exists
- No redundancy with tier-2 specs (only orchestration, not design)

### Implementation Considerations

**Effort:**
- Upfront: MEDIUM (4-6 hours to create GUIDE002)
- Per-use: MEDIUM (orchestrated /plan invocations + integration)
- Maintenance: MEDIUM (update as specs evolve, but less than SPEC023)
- Total estimated: 10-14 hours (6 hours creation + 1 hour /plan per spec + integration)

**Dependencies:**
- All source SPEC documents
- SPEC021 approval recommended
- Understanding of WKMP increment strategy

**Complexity: MEDIUM**
- Requires understanding all source specs
- Must design increment order
- Must coordinate cross-cutting concerns

### Advantages

✅ Correct tier placement per GOV001 hierarchy
✅ Single orchestration point for implementation
✅ No redundancy with source specs (only references)
✅ Precedent exists (GUIDE001)
✅ At-risk decisions documented centrally
✅ Test strategy and acceptance criteria defined
✅ Living document expectation at EXEC tier (maintenance acceptable)

### Disadvantages

❌ Medium upfront effort (4-6 hours)
❌ Requires maintenance as specs evolve
❌ Still requires multiple /plan invocations (orchestrated but not eliminated)
