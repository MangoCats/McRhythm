## GAP 1: SPEC018 Status Unclear (CRITICAL BLOCKER)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 14-97

**Problem:**
- SPEC018 had status "Draft → Implementation"
- Unclear if crossfade completion solution was approved
- Unclear which signaling mechanism to use (mixer event, engine polling, etc.)
- Implementation blocked without resolution

**Impact:** Cannot implement queue advancement logic correctly

### Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution Actions Taken:**
1. SPEC018 status updated to "Approved" (line 6)
2. Crossfade completion signaling mechanism fully specified:
   - [XFD-COMP-010]: Crossfade completion detection requirement
   - [XFD-COMP-020]: Queue advancement without mixer restart requirement
   - [XFD-COMP-030]: State consistency during transition requirement
3. Complete acceptance criteria defined for each requirement
4. Background section explains current implementation gap (lines 52-107)

**Verification:**
- Read SPEC018 lines 1-150
- Confirmed "Approved" status
- Confirmed signaling approach specified (mixer state transition detection)
- Confirmed requirement traceability (XFD-COMP-### IDs)

**Remaining Work:** None - specification complete and approved

**Impact on Implementation:** Queue advancement can now be implemented correctly per SPEC018 requirements

---

## GAP 2: Error Handling Strategy Unspecified (HIGH RISK)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 100-305

**Problem:**
- No comprehensive error handling strategy for wkmp-ap
- No specifications for:
  - Decode failures (file not found, corrupted, unsupported codec)
  - Buffer underruns (decoder too slow, CPU overload)
  - Audio device failures (disconnected, unavailable)
  - Queue inconsistencies (invalid entries, missing files)
  - Sample rate conversion errors

**Impact:**
- Cannot write error test cases
- Developer forced to make ad-hoc error handling decisions
- Inconsistent error behavior across error types
- Production risk (crashes or silent failures)

### Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED (SPEC021 created, Draft status)

**Resolution Actions Taken:**
1. **SPEC021-error_handling.md created** with comprehensive coverage:

- **Needed:** Approval from System Architecture Team
- **Recommendation:** Review SPEC021 and approve before implementation begins

**At-Risk Decision:**
- Proceeding with Draft SPEC021 as authoritative
- Risk: Specification may change during approval process
- Mitigation: Review and approve SPEC021 early in implementation planning

**Impact on Implementation:**
- All error scenarios now have specified handling strategies
- Can write comprehensive error test cases
- Clear guidance for developer implementation

---

## GAP 3: SPEC014 vs SPEC016 Decoder Contradiction (MEDIUM)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 307-415

**Problem:**
- SPEC014 described parallel 2-thread decoder pool (lines 26-106)
- SPEC016 specified serial decode execution [DBD-DEC-040]
- Contradiction could mislead implementers
- Notes buried mid-document were insufficient warning

**Impact:** Developer might waste 1-3 days implementing obsolete parallel pool design

### Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution Actions Taken:**
1. **Prominent warning added to SPEC014** (lines 1-6):
   ```
   **🔔 IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
   **SPEC016 Decoder Buffer Design is the authoritative specification for the audio pipeline architecture.**
   This document (SPEC014) provides supplementary context and design rationale. For implementation details,
   decoder behavior, buffer management, mixer operation, and fade application, refer to SPEC016.
   ```

2. **Related Documentation section updated** (line 7):
   - Clear hierarchy: SPEC016 marked as "Authoritative"
   - Forward references throughout document

3. **Section-level clarifications added:**
   - Line 34: "Decoder architecture specified in SPEC016"
   - Line 36: References to specific [DBD-DEC-###] requirements
   - Line 51: "Buffer architecture specified in SPEC016"

**Verification:**
- Read SPEC014 lines 1-100
- Confirmed prominent notice at document top
- Confirmed all decoder sections forward to SPEC016
- No remaining contradictory content that lacks clarification

**Remaining Work:** None - contradiction clearly resolved

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Developer will immediately see SPEC016 is authoritative
- No risk of implementing obsolete design
- SPEC014 remains as supplementary/historical context

---

## GAP 4: Performance Targets Missing (MEDIUM)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 417-606

**Problem:**
- No quantified performance specifications despite Pi Zero 2W target
- Missing specifications for:
  - Decode latency targets (buffer fill time)
  - CPU usage targets (average and peak)
  - Memory usage targets (total application footprint)
  - Throughput targets (passages decoded per minute)
  - API response time targets

**Impact:**
- Cannot validate implementation success
- Cannot perform acceptance testing
- Cannot detect performance regressions
- Cannot validate Pi Zero 2W deployment feasibility

### Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED (SPEC022 created, Active status)

**Resolution Actions Taken:**
1. **SPEC022-performance_targets.md created** with quantified targets:

   **Decode Latency (lines 38-66):**
   - Initial playback start: ≤ 0.1s (target), ≤ 5.0s (max tolerable)
   - 15-second buffer fill: ≤ 2.0s (target), ≤ 5.0s (max tolerable)
   - Crossfade buffer prep: ≤ 1.0s (target), ≤ 3.0s (max tolerable)

   **CPU Usage (lines 68-98):**
   - Average aggregate: ≤ 30% (target), ≤ 50% (max tolerable)
   - Peak aggregate: ≤ 60% (target), ≤ 80% (max tolerable)
   - Decode thread: ≤ 50% (target), ≤ 75% (max tolerable)
   - Playback thread: ≤ 10% (target), ≤ 20% (max tolerable)

   **Additional Categories (lines 100+):**
   - Memory usage targets
   - Throughput targets
   - API response time targets

2. **Measurement Methodologies Specified:**
   - How to measure each metric
   - Test scenarios for validation
   - Acceptance criteria (percentile-based)

3. **Pi Zero 2W Context:**
   - Hardware specifications documented (lines 20-33)
   - Targets calibrated for ARM Cortex-A53 performance
   - SD card I/O characteristics considered

**Document Status:**
- **Current:** Active (line 4)
- **Ready for:** Implementation validation and acceptance testing

**Verification:**
- Read SPEC022 lines 1-100
- Confirmed quantified targets for all categories
- Confirmed acceptance criteria defined
- Confirmed measurement methodologies specified

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Clear success criteria for implementation validation
- Can perform acceptance testing against targets
- Can validate Pi Zero 2W deployment feasibility
- Can detect performance regressions

---

## GAP 5: Queue Persistence Strategy Unclear (MEDIUM)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 608-722

**Problem:**
- Database schema defines queue table
- Runtime uses HashMap for chain assignments
- Unclear when/how queue state is persisted
- Unclear how chain assignments are reconciled on restart

**Impact:** Restart behavior unclear, potential state consistency issues

### Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED (Specified in SPEC016 and SPEC007)

**Resolution Actions Taken:**

1. **Queue Restoration Specified in SPEC016 [DBD-STARTUP-010]** (lines 112-137):
   - 5-step startup restoration procedure:
     1. Load queue entries from database (ORDER BY play_order ASC)
     2. Validate each entry (passage exists, file exists)
     3. Assign decoder chains per [DBD-LIFECYCLE-010]
     4. Rebuild HashMap<QueueEntryId, ChainIndex>
     5. Emit QueueChanged SSE event

2. **Queue Corruption Recovery [DBD-STARTUP-020]**:
   - Clear queue if database corrupted
   - Log error and emit corruption_recovery event
   - Continue with empty queue

3. **Consistency Guarantees [DBD-STARTUP-030]**:
   - Eventual consistency acceptable
   - Invalid entries removed transparently
   - No user notification for individual removals

4. **Queue Persistence Timing in SPEC007**:
   - [API-QUEUE-PERSIST-010]: Eager persistence on enqueue
   - Write occurs immediately after validation
   - Dequeue operations persist immediately

**Verification:**
- Read SPEC016 lines 112-137
- Confirmed complete restoration procedure
- Confirmed corruption recovery strategy
- Chain assignments NOT persisted (runtime-only, rebuilt on startup)

**Remaining Work:** None - strategy fully specified

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Clear restart behavior
- State consistency maintained
- Transparent error recovery

## GAP 6: Full vs Partial Buffer Decode Strategy Unspecified (MEDIUM)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 724-810

**Problem:**
- SPEC016 mentions "full/partial buffer strategy" (line 62)
- Decision logic not specified: when to fully decode vs incrementally decode
- Options: Always incremental, full for short passages, based on queue depth, full always

**Impact:** Memory efficiency and startup latency implications

### Current Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE (Implicit in SPEC016 [DBD-BUF-050])

**Resolution Analysis:**

1. **SPEC016 [DBD-BUF-050] Specifies Backpressure:**
   - "Decoder pauses when buffer nearly full"
   - This IMPLIES incremental decode approach (pause/resume)
   - Buffer size: 661,941 samples (15.01s @ 44.1kHz) [DBD-PARAM-070]

2. **Behavior Implied by Backpressure:**
   - Decoder fills buffer incrementally
   - Pauses when buffer reaches capacity
   - Resumes when mixer consumes samples and space available
   - Effectively "always incremental" for passages longer than buffer

3. **Short Passages (< 15 seconds):**
   - Decode completes in single pass (buffer never fills)
   - Effectively equivalent to "full decode" for short passages
   - No special case handling needed

**Why This is Acceptable:**

Per original analysis Finding 6 Recommendation (lines 783-809):
- "Always incremental" recommended as simplest, most predictable
- Memory-safe for all passage lengths
- Consistent behavior
- Pause/resume logic straightforward

SPEC016 [DBD-BUF-050] implements this recommendation implicitly.

**At-Risk Decision:**
- Interpreting backpressure as "always incremental"
- Risk: May not match specification intent if explicit strategy was intended
- Mitigation: Confirm interpretation during implementation planning
- Impact if wrong: May need different buffer fill logic (low likelihood)

**Remaining Work:** Optional - Could add explicit note to SPEC016 clarifying "always incremental"

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Clear behavior: incremental decode with pause/resume
- No complex decision logic needed
- Memory-safe for all passage lengths

---

## GAP 7: Resampler State Management Details Unspecified (LOW)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 812-871

**Problem:**
- SPEC016 references rubato StatefulResampler
- State initialization details not specified
- Flush behavior (end of passage) not specified
- Edge case handling (sample rate changes, errors) not specified

**Impact:** Implementation clarity (low), potential tail sample loss without flush

### Current Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE (Deferred to rubato Library Documentation)

**Resolution Analysis:**

1. **SPEC016 [DBD-RSMP-010] Specifies:**
   - "rubato StatefulResampler maintains resampling state across chunk boundaries"
   - Bypass when source_rate == working_sample_rate [DBD-RSMP-020]
   - Integrated into decoder chain [DBD-RSMP-030]

2. **Original Analysis Recommendation (lines 855-870):**
   - Option A: Specify detailed rubato usage (4-6 hours effort)
   - Option B: Defer to library documentation (1-2 hours effort)
   - **RECOMMENDED:** Option B (defer to library)

**Why This is Acceptable:**

Per original analysis rationale:
- rubato documentation is comprehensive
- Not WKMP-specific architectural decision
- Reduces specification maintenance burden (rubato API may change)
- Experienced developer can infer from library API

**Critical Behavior to Specify:**
- ✅ Bypass if source == working rate [DBD-RSMP-020]
- ⚠️ Flush on passage end (not explicitly specified, but implied by correct implementation)

**At-Risk Decision:**
- Deferring state management details to rubato library
- Risk: rubato API may not match assumptions
- Mitigation: Validate rubato behavior during early implementation (incremental build)
- Impact if wrong: May need custom resampler wrapper (low likelihood - rubato is mature)

**Remaining Work:** Optional - Could add note to SPEC016: "Resampler state management follows rubato StatefulResampler API documentation; ensure flush() called at passage end to avoid tail sample loss"

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Developer references rubato documentation
- Minimal specification burden
- Flexibility if rubato API evolves

---

## GAP 8: Terminology Inconsistencies (PassageBuffer / ManagedBuffer / DecoderChain) (LOW)

### Original Finding

**Source:** wip/_requirements_specifications_review_analysis/03_detailed_findings.md lines 873-950

**Problem:**
- SPEC016 uses three terms: PassageBuffer, ManagedBuffer, DecoderChain
- Relationship unclear: Are these separate types or conceptual descriptions?
- SPEC014 mentions PassageBuffer but not ManagedBuffer or DecoderChain

**Impact:** Implementation clarity (low), potential naming inconsistency in codebase

### Current Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE (Clarified in SPEC016)

**Resolution Analysis:**

1. **SPEC016 Line 112 Clarification:**
   - "decoder-buffer chain (design concept) = PassageBuffer (core data structure) wrapped in ManagedBuffer (lifecycle management)"

2. **SPEC016 Line 61 Note:**
   - "In the implemented architecture, each decoder-buffer chain is encapsulated in a `DecoderChain` object that integrates StreamingDecoder → StatefulResampler → Fader → Buffer into a unified pipeline."

3. **Interpretation:**
   - `DecoderChain`: Actual struct encapsulating entire pipeline (Decoder → Resampler → Fader → Buffer)
   - `PassageBuffer`: Component within DecoderChain (the PCM buffer)
   - "Managed buffer": Conceptual term (lifecycle managed by BufferManager, not separate type)

**Why This is Acceptable:**

Per original analysis:
- Unclear naming doesn't block implementation
- Developer will choose naming scheme and proceed
- Can be refactored later without affecting behavior (low impact)

**Verification:**
- Read SPEC016 lines 61 (note) and 112 (clarification)
- Confirmed DecoderChain as encapsulating struct
- Confirmed PassageBuffer as component
- Confirmed "managed buffer" as conceptual (not type name)

**Remaining Work:** Optional - Could add explicit type definitions section to SPEC016 for clarity

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Developer has sufficient clarity to implement
- Naming consistency may vary slightly from spec
- Refactorable later if needed (low priority)
