# At-Risk Decisions Documentation

**Section:** Documented assumptions and risks for wkmp-ap implementation
**Parent Document:** [00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md)

---

## Purpose

This document explicitly records decisions made during specification consolidation analysis where proceeding requires accepting risk due to incomplete information, unresolved conflicts, or pending approvals.

---

## At-Risk Decision Framework

**Definition:** An at-risk decision is one where:
1. Information is incomplete but implementation cannot wait
2. Specification has Draft status but is needed for planning
3. Interpretation of ambiguous specification is required
4. External dependency (library, hardware) behavior is assumed

**Documentation Standard:**
- **Decision:** What assumption or interpretation is being made
- **Risk:** What could go wrong if assumption is incorrect
- **Mitigation:** How to reduce likelihood or impact
- **Impact if Changed:** What rework would be required
- **Approval Authority:** Who can change this decision

---

## AT-RISK DECISION 1: SPEC021 Draft Status

### Decision

**Proceed with implementation planning using Draft SPEC021 (Error Handling Strategy) as authoritative specification.**

### Risk Details

**Risk Category:** Specification Approval
**Probability:** LOW (specification is comprehensive and well-structured)
**Impact if Changed:** MEDIUM (error handling approach may need revision)

**What Could Go Wrong:**
1. SPEC021 approval process identifies errors or gaps
2. Error taxonomy changes (FATAL/RECOVERABLE/DEGRADED/TRANSIENT)
3. Error response strategies change (retry counts, backoff, fallback)
4. Event definitions change (error event types, payloads)

**Consequences:**
- Implemented error handling may not match approved specification
- Test cases may need revision
- Error recovery logic may need refactoring
- Event emission code may need updates

### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Early Review and Approval**
- Schedule SPEC021 review with System Architecture Team
- Target approval before implementation begins
- Timeline: Within 1 week of implementation kickoff

**2. Incremental Implementation**
- Implement error handling incrementally (one category at a time)
- Start with high-probability errors (decode failures, buffer underruns)
- Defer low-probability errors until SPEC021 approved
- Allows course correction if specification changes

**3. Abstraction Layer**
- Implement error handling through abstract traits/interfaces
- Allows strategy changes without touching all callsites
- Example: `trait ErrorHandler { fn handle_decode_error(...) }`

**4. Comprehensive Testing**
- Write tests based on Draft SPEC021 requirements
- Tests serve as regression suite if specification changes
- Easier to identify what broke when specification updates

### Impact if Decision Changes

**If SPEC021 Substantially Revised:**
- **Effort:** 2-4 days to refactor error handling
- **Scope:** Primarily error handling module + tests
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (contained scope, well-tested)

**If SPEC021 Approved As-Is:**
- **Effort:** None
- **Validation:** Tests confirm implementation matches approved spec

**If SPEC021 Approval Delayed:**
- **Action:** Continue implementation with Draft as basis
- **Risk:** Acceptable (Draft is comprehensive)

### Approval Authority

**Who Can Change This Decision:**
- System Architecture Team (SPEC021 approval authority)
- Technical Lead (implementation planning authority)

**Change Process:**
1. Review Draft SPEC021
2. Approve with/without modifications
3. If modified: Assess impact on implementation
4. If significant: Pause implementation, revise plan
5. If minor: Continue with noted changes

### Current Status

**Status:** ⚠️ AT RISK (Draft specification, not yet approved)
**Timeline:** Review scheduled (pending)
**Recommended Action:** Approve SPEC021 before implementation begins

## AT-RISK DECISION 2: Resampler State Management

### Decision

**Defer resampler state management details to rubato library documentation; assume library provides correct flush behavior.**

### Risk Details

**Risk Category:** External Library Dependency
**Probability:** LOW (rubato is mature, well-documented)
**Impact if Wrong:** LOW (custom wrapper can be added if needed)

**What Could Go Wrong:**
1. rubato StatefulResampler API doesn't provide flush() method
2. rubato flush behavior loses tail samples (incorrect implementation)
3. rubato state management incompatible with pause/resume decode
4. rubato memory usage higher than expected

**Consequences:**
- Tail sample loss at passage end (audible click/pop)
- Resampler state corruption across pause/resume
- Need to implement custom resampler wrapper
- Performance degradation

### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Early Validation**
- Review rubato documentation before implementation
- Verify StatefulResampler provides required functionality
- Prototype resampler integration early
- Timeline: During implementation kickoff week

**2. Incremental Integration**
- Implement resampler integration as early increment
- Test with various sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz)
- Validate flush behavior with tail sample detection tests
- Identify issues before pipeline integration complete

**3. Fallback Plan**
- If rubato insufficient: Implement custom wrapper
- Wrapper can delegate to rubato for core functionality
- Add explicit flush logic if library lacks it
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days

**4. Acceptance Testing**
- Test: Passage end produces no audible artifacts
- Test: Sample count matches expected (no lost samples)
- Test: Pause/resume preserves resampler state
- Test: Various sample rate conversions (44.1→48, 96→44.1, etc.)

### Impact if Decision Changes

**If rubato API Sufficient:**
- **Effort:** None (assumption validated)
- **Implementation:** Straightforward integration per rubato docs

**If rubato API Insufficient:**
- **Effort:** 1-2 days to implement custom wrapper
- **Scope:** Resampler integration module only
- **Risk:** LOW (contained scope, well-understood problem)

**If Alternative Resampler Needed:**
- **Effort:** 3-5 days to evaluate and integrate alternative (e.g., libsamplerate bindings)
- **Scope:** Resampler integration + dependencies
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (new dependency, FFI complexity if C library)

### Approval Authority

**Who Can Change This Decision:**
- Implementation team (during early validation)
- Technical Lead (if alternative resampler required)

**Change Process:**
1. Validate rubato API during implementation kickoff
2. If insufficient: Propose custom wrapper or alternative
3. Technical Lead approves approach
4. Implement solution
5. Update SPEC016 if significant deviation from rubato

### Current Status

**Status:** ⚠️ AT RISK (Assumption, not validated)
**Timeline:** Validation during implementation kickoff week
**Recommended Action:** Review rubato documentation before implementation begins

## AT-RISK DECISION 3: Buffer Decode Strategy Interpretation

### Decision

**Interpret SPEC016 [DBD-BUF-050] backpressure mechanism as "always incremental" decode strategy (pause when buffer full, resume when space available).**

### Risk Details

**Risk Category:** Specification Interpretation
**Probability:** LOW (backpressure strongly implies incremental decode)
**Impact if Wrong:** LOW (alternative strategies have similar implementation patterns)

**What Could Go Wrong:**
1. Specification intended different strategy (full decode for short passages)
2. Backpressure intended only for long passages, not all passages
3. Performance characteristics differ from expected (more context switches)

**Consequences:**
- Implementation doesn't match specification intent
- May need to refactor buffer fill logic
- Test cases may be based on wrong assumptions

### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Confirm Interpretation**
- Review SPEC016 [DBD-BUF-050] with System Architecture Team
- Explicitly confirm "always incremental" interpretation
- Timeline: During implementation planning (before coding begins)

**2. Incremental Validation**
- Implement buffer fill logic early in pipeline
- Test with both short (<15s) and long (>15s) passages
- Measure performance characteristics
- Validate against SPEC022 performance targets

**3. Flexible Implementation**
- Implement buffer fill as pluggable strategy pattern
- Easy to swap "always incremental" for "full for short, incremental for long"
- Minimal refactoring if interpretation changes

**4. Performance Testing**
- Measure decode latency for various passage lengths
- Validate CPU usage during pause/resume cycles
- Ensure no unexpected overhead from pause/resume

### Impact if Decision Changes

**If Interpretation Confirmed:**
- **Effort:** None (assumption validated)
- **Implementation:** Proceed as planned

**If Alternative Strategy Needed:**
- **Effort:** 1-2 days to implement strategy selection logic
- **Scope:** Buffer fill logic + configuration
- **Risk:** LOW (contained scope, well-understood problem)

**If Performance Issues Discovered:**
- **Effort:** 2-3 days to optimize pause/resume logic
- **Scope:** Decoder worker + buffer management
- **Risk:** LOW (optimization, not redesign)

### Approval Authority

**Who Can Change This Decision:**
- System Architecture Team (SPEC016 interpretation authority)
- Technical Lead (implementation planning authority)

**Change Process:**
1. Confirm interpretation with System Architecture Team
2. If confirmed: Proceed as planned
3. If alternative: Update implementation plan
4. Optionally: Add clarifying note to SPEC016

### Current Status

**Status:** ⚠️ AT RISK (Interpretation, not explicitly confirmed)
**Timeline:** Confirmation during implementation planning
**Recommended Action:** Explicit confirmation before coding begins (low urgency - interpretation well-founded)
