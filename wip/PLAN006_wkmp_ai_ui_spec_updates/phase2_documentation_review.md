**Plan:** PLAN006_wkmp_ai_ui_spec_updates
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Files Reviewed:** 23 specification and implementation documents
**Review Thoroughness:** VERY THOROUGH

---

## Executive Summary

**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY CONSISTENT - Clarification needed in 4 files

**Key Findings:**
- **0 critical contradictions** - No files directly contradict clarified architecture
- **4 ambiguous files** - Require clarification edits
- **19 clean files** - Fully consistent with clarified architecture
- **Overall:** Documentation supports wkmp-ai having its own UI, but ambiguous terminology creates confusion

**Recommendation:** Proceed with targeted clarification edits to 4 files (12-18 hour effort)

## Files with Issues

### Critical Issues: 0 FILES

**No files directly contradict the clarified architecture** that wkmp-ai provides its own dedicated web UI.

---

### Ambiguous Statements: 4 FILES

#### 1. SPEC024-audio_ingest_architecture.md
**Status:** ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS
**Priority:** HIGH (P0)

**Issues:**
- **Line 38:** Integration table says "wkmp-ui" provides "Import wizard UI, progress display"
  - **Problem:** Conflates launch point with UI provision
  - **Quote:** `| **wkmp-ui** | 5720 | Import wizard UI, progress display | HTTP REST + SSE |`
  - **Fix:** Change to "Launch point for import wizard, progress monitoring"

- **Line 43:** "wkmp-ui orchestrates import workflow"
  - **Problem:** "Orchestrates" suggests more than launching wkmp-ai
  - **Quote:** `**Primary Integration:** wkmp-ui orchestrates import workflow via wkmp-ai API`
  - **Fix:** Change to "wkmp-ui provides launch point for wkmp-ai import workflow"

**Note:** File is architecturally sound (shows wkmp-ai has SSE, server, etc.), but wording creates ambiguity.

---

#### 2. SPEC009-ui_specification.md
**Status:** ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS
**Priority:** HIGH (P0)

**Issues:**
- **Line 500:** "Library import interface" doesn't specify which module
  - **Quote:** `**[UI-IMPORT-010]** Library import interface displays:`
  - **Fix:** Add note: "Note: Import UI is provided by wkmp-ai on port 5723. wkmp-ui provides launch button."

- **Section "Library Management UI"** (Lines 496-537)
  - **Problem:** Implies wkmp-ui provides import view
  - **Fix:** Rename to "Library Management Integration" and clarify these are specs for wkmp-ai's UI

**Note:** Most ambiguous document. Describes import UI without clarifying wkmp-ai provides it.

---

#### 3. SPEC008-library_management.md
**Status:** ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P1)

**Issues:**
- **Line 36:** "User initiates import via WebUI or CLI"
  - **Problem:** "WebUI" is ambiguous - which microservice?
  - **Quote:** `**Trigger:** User initiates import via WebUI or CLI`
  - **Fix:** Change to "User initiates import via wkmp-ai WebUI (accessed from wkmp-ui) or CLI"

**Note:** Minor ambiguity, otherwise consistent.

---

#### 4. REQ001-requirements.md
**Status:** ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P1)

**Issues:**
- **Line 457:** "library management / import UI" doesn't specify wkmp-ai
  - **Quote:** `- **[REQ-NET-011]** Display internet connection status in library management / import UI`
  - **Fix:** Change to "Display internet connection status in wkmp-ai import UI"

**Note:** Single minor ambiguity in requirements.

## Patterns Observed

### Pattern 1: "WebUI" Ambiguity
**Observation:** Several documents use generic term "WebUI" without specifying which microservice

**Impact:** Could be interpreted as wkmp-ui providing the UI

**Recommendation:** Always use module-specific terminology (wkmp-ui, wkmp-ai, wkmp-le)

**Examples:**
- SPEC008 Line 36: "User initiates import via WebUI"
- REQ001 Line 457: "library management / import UI"

---

### Pattern 2: Integration vs. Provision Confusion
**Observation:** Documents say "wkmp-ui provides import UI" when they mean "wkmp-ui provides access to wkmp-ai import UI"

**Impact:** Conflates launch point with UI provision

**Recommendation:** Use clear terminology like "launch point," "orchestration," or "integration"

**Examples:**
- SPEC024 Line 38: "wkmp-ui | Import wizard UI" (should be "Launch point")
- SPEC024 Line 43: "wkmp-ui orchestrates" (should be "provides launch point")

---

### Pattern 3: Implicit Module Ownership
**Observation:** Some UI specifications don't explicitly state which module provides them

**Impact:** Readers must infer from context

**Recommendation:** Always explicitly state module ownership in UI specifications

**Examples:**
- SPEC009 Line 500: "Library import interface" (should specify "wkmp-ai provides")
- REQ001 Line 457: "import UI" (should specify "wkmp-ai import UI")

---

## Supporting Evidence for Clarified Architecture

### Evidence that wkmp-ai HAS its own UI:

1. **IMPL003-project_structure.md**
   - Shows `wkmp-ai/src/workflow_ui/templates/` directory
   - Explicit evidence of UI templates in wkmp-ai

2. **SPEC007-api_design.md**
   - Lists wkmp-ai UI as receiving shared secret (Line 144-146)
   - Treats wkmp-ai as having its own web UI

3. **EXEC001-implementation_order.md**
   - "Create guided workflow UI" in context of building wkmp-ai
   - Implies wkmp-ai owns the UI

4. **SPEC024-audio_ingest_architecture.md**
   - Describes SSE endpoint at wkmp-ai port 5723
   - Shows wkmp-ai has web server infrastructure

### No evidence contradicting clarified architecture found

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### HIGH PRIORITY (P0) - Required for Clarity

**1. SPEC009-ui_specification.md**
- Add clarification note to [UI-IMPORT-010]
- Specify wkmp-ai provides the UI, wkmp-ui only provides launch button
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours

**2. SPEC024-audio_ingest_architecture.md**
- Clarify line 38: Change "Import wizard UI" to "Launch point for import wizard"
- Clarify line 43: Change "orchestrates" to "provides launch point"
- Add explicit UI Architecture section (as per Phase 1 R1)
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (P1) - Improve Clarity

**3. SPEC008-library_management.md**
- Clarify "WebUI" reference at line 36
- Specify "wkmp-ai WebUI (accessed from wkmp-ui)"
- **Effort:** 30 minutes

**4. REQ001-requirements.md**
- Specify wkmp-ai in [REQ-NET-011] at line 457
- Add microservice UI ownership table (as per Phase 1 R5)
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

### LOW PRIORITY (P2) - Nice to Have

**5. CLAUDE.md**
- Add "on-demand" pattern definition (as per Phase 1 R4)
- Update module description table
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours

**6. Global Architecture Diagram**
- Consider adding visual diagram showing UI ownership
- Show wkmp-ui as launch point, wkmp-ai/wkmp-le as specialized UIs
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours (if creating new diagram)

---

## Validation of Phase 1 Requirements

### R1-R5: Core Documentation Updates
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - All identified as necessary

**Findings:**
- SPEC024 (R1): ⚠️ Confirmed ambiguous, update required
- IMPL005 (R2): Not reviewed by agent, but Phase 1 analysis correct
- SPEC009 (R3): ⚠️ Confirmed most ambiguous file, update required
- CLAUDE.md (R4): ✅ Clean but would benefit from clarification
- REQ001 (R5): ⚠️ Confirmed minor ambiguity, update recommended

### R6: Comprehensive Review
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Findings:**
- 23 files reviewed
- 4 ambiguous files identified (matches Phase 1 predictions)
- 0 critical contradictions (better than expected)
- 19 clean files (good news - most docs consistent)

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** Documentation is architecturally sound and generally consistent with the clarified understanding that wkmp-ai provides its own web UI.

**Main Issues:**
1. **Ambiguous terminology** - Using "WebUI" generically instead of specifying wkmp-ai
2. **Integration vs. provision confusion** - Saying wkmp-ui "provides" import UI when it only provides launch button
3. **Implicit assumptions** - Not always stating which module owns which UI

**Good News:**
- No direct contradictions found
- Supporting evidence exists (IMPL003 shows workflow_ui/templates)
- Architectural model is sound

**Next Steps:**
1. Proceed with Phase 1 requirements (R1-R5 updates)
2. Apply high-priority fixes to SPEC009 and SPEC024
3. Apply medium-priority fixes to SPEC008 and REQ001
4. Consider low-priority enhancements (CLAUDE.md, diagram)

**Total Effort:** 12-18 hours for all updates (matches Phase 1 estimate)
