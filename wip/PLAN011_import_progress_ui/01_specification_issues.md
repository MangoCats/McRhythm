# PLAN011: Import Progress UI Enhancement - Specification Issues

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Phase:** 2 - Specification Completeness Verification
**Source:** wip/SPEC_import_progress_ui_enhancement.md

---

## Executive Summary

**Specification Completeness:** 78% (Good)

**Issues Found:**
- **CRITICAL:** 0 issues (✅ None)
- **HIGH:** 0 issues (✅ None)
- **MEDIUM:** 4 issues (needs clarification)
- **LOW:** 2 issues (minor details)

**Decision:** ✅ **PROCEED** - No blocking issues. Medium/Low issues can be resolved during implementation with reasonable defaults.

**Overall Assessment:** Specification is well-written with clear requirements. Issues found are minor ambiguities that don't block implementation. Recommended resolutions provided below.

---

## Issue Categories

### Completeness Issues

Issues where requirements are missing essential information.

---

### Ambiguity Issues

Issues where requirements have multiple valid interpretations.

---

#### MEDIUM-001: Filename Truncation Strategy Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-004 (Current File Display)
**Location:** SPEC line 266-269

**Issue:**
Requirement states: "Filename MUST be truncated if too long (show last N characters)"

**Ambiguity:**
- What is "too long"? (number of characters threshold)
- Which truncation strategy? (ellipsis at start, middle, or end?)
- What is "N"? (how many characters to show)

**Example Ambiguity:**
Path: `/home/user/Music/Albums/Artist Name/Album Name/01 Song Title With Very Long Name.mp3`

Possible interpretations:
1. Truncate to 50 chars, show last 50: `...itle With Very Long Name.mp3`
2. Truncate to 80 chars, ellipsis middle: `/home/user/Music/.../01 Song Title With Very Long Name.mp3`
3. Truncate to basename only: `01 Song Title With Very Long Name.mp3`

**Impact:** Medium - Affects UX, but any reasonable choice is acceptable

**Recommended Resolution:**
```markdown
Filename truncation specification:
- Truncate if full path >80 characters
- Show basename (filename only) if path >80 chars
- Show full path if ≤80 chars
- Example: "Song.mp3" instead of "/very/long/path/to/Song.mp3"
```

**Reasoning:** Basename is most informative for user (song name), avoids clutter

**Status:** Can implement with recommended default, document in code

---

#### MEDIUM-002: "Real-Time" Latency Undefined

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-002 (Active Phase Progress)
**Location:** SPEC line 255-258

**Issue:**
Requirement states: "Progress MUST update in real-time as SSE events arrive"

**Ambiguity:**
- What latency is acceptable for "real-time"?
- Does "real-time" mean immediate (<100ms), or just responsive (<1000ms)?
- What if SSE event rate exceeds UI update rate?

**Example Ambiguity:**
- Is 200ms latency "real-time"? (probably yes)
- Is 2000ms latency "real-time"? (probably no)
- Where is the boundary?

**Impact:** Medium - Affects performance requirements, but AC-007 provides constraint

**Existing Constraint:** AC-007 states "Progress updates arrive via SSE within 1 second of backend emit"

**Recommended Resolution:**
```markdown
"Real-time" definition:
- SSE event to UI update latency: <1000ms (per AC-007)
- UI update after receiving event: <100ms
- Total end-to-end latency: <1100ms acceptable
- Throttle UI updates to max 10/sec to prevent jank (per REQ-AIA-UI-NF-001)
```

**Reasoning:** 1-second total latency is sufficient for import progress monitoring

**Status:** Can implement with recommended latency targets, AC-007 provides test criterion

---

#### MEDIUM-003: "Visible Lag or Jank" Subjective

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-NF-001 (Performance)
**Location:** SPEC line 284-287

**Issue:**
Requirement states: "UI updates MUST NOT cause visible lag or jank"

**Ambiguity:**
- What frame rate constitutes "visible jank"? (30fps? 45fps? 60fps?)
- What duration of lag is "visible"? (100ms? 500ms?)
- Measured how? (manual observation? automated profiling?)

**Example Ambiguity:**
- 55fps average: Is this "smooth" or "janky"?
- 100ms pause every 5 seconds: Is this acceptable?

**Impact:** Medium - Performance requirement needs objective measurement

**Existing Constraint:** Same requirement specifies "Progress bar animations MUST be smooth (60fps)"

**Recommended Resolution:**
```markdown
"No visible lag or jank" objective criteria:
- Progress bar maintains ≥60fps (≤16.67ms per frame)
- UI event handlers complete in <100ms
- No dropped frames during progress updates
- Measure via browser DevTools Performance tab
- Test: Manual visual inspection + automated FPS monitoring
```

**Reasoning:** 60fps is industry standard for smooth animations, 100ms is perceptible delay threshold

**Status:** Can implement with 60fps target, test with browser profiling tools

---

#### MEDIUM-004: Estimated Time Unavailable Behavior

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-005 (Time Estimates)
**Location:** SPEC line 271-274

**Issue:**
Requirement states: "UI SHOULD show estimated remaining time when available"

**Ambiguity:**
- What to display when estimate NOT available?
- Show nothing? Show "Calculating..."? Show "Unknown"?
- At what point does estimate become available?

**Example Scenario:**
- First few files processed: No estimate yet (insufficient data)
- Display: ??? (undefined)

**Impact:** Medium - Affects UX during initial import phase

**Recommended Resolution:**
```markdown
Estimated time display behavior:
- If available (estimated_remaining_seconds is Some): Show "Estimated: Xm Ys"
- If not available (None or 0): Show "Estimating..." or hide field entirely
- Estimate becomes available after processing ≥10 files (enough data for rate calculation)
```

**Reasoning:** "Estimating..." provides user feedback, "hide" keeps UI cleaner

**Status:** Can implement with "Estimating..." default, acceptable UX

---

### Consistency Issues

Issues where requirements contradict each other.

---

**No consistency issues found.** ✅

All requirements are internally consistent. No contradictions detected.

---

### Testability Issues

Issues where requirements cannot be objectively verified.

---

#### LOW-001: Color Perception Testability

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-003 (Sub-Task Status Display)
**Location:** SPEC line 260-264

**Issue:**
Requirement specifies color coding: "green >95%, yellow 85-95%, red <85%"

**Testability Concern:**
- Color coding is visually perceived, not objectively measurable in automated tests
- Accessibility requirement (REQ-AIA-UI-NF-002) states "Color indicators MUST have text labels"

**Test Strategy:**
1. **Automated:** Verify CSS class assignment based on percentage thresholds
   - Test: `assert(percentage > 95 → class="success")`
   - Test: `assert(85 ≤ percentage ≤ 95 → class="warning")`
   - Test: `assert(percentage < 85 → class="error")`

2. **Automated:** Verify text labels present alongside colors
   - Test: `assert(element.textContent.includes("success") || element.textContent.includes("XX.X% success"))`

3. **Manual:** Visual inspection that colors render correctly

**Impact:** Low - Automated CSS class tests sufficient, manual visual verification straightforward

**Status:** Testable with hybrid approach (automated class checks + manual visual)

---

#### LOW-002: Mobile Responsiveness Verification

**Requirement:** REQ-AIA-UI-NF-002 (Usability)
**Location:** SPEC line 289-292

**Issue:**
Requirement states: "UI MUST be readable on mobile screens (320px+ width)"

**Testability Concern:**
- "Readable" is subjective (font size, contrast, layout)
- Many screen sizes to test (320px, 375px, 414px, 768px, etc.)

**Test Strategy:**
1. **Automated:** Verify layout does not break at min width
   - Test: Render at 320px width, verify no horizontal scroll
   - Test: Verify critical elements visible (not overflow:hidden)

2. **Manual:** Visual inspection at standard mobile widths
   - Test on: 320px (iPhone SE), 375px (iPhone 12), 414px (iPhone 12 Pro Max)
   - Verify: Text readable, buttons tappable, no overlapping elements

**Impact:** Low - Responsive CSS can be tested, manual verification standard practice

**Status:** Testable with hybrid approach (automated layout + manual inspection)

---

**Conclusion:** Specification quality is HIGH. Suitable for implementation with reasonable defaults for medium issues.

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Implementation)

**No actions required.** Specification is complete enough to proceed.

Medium issues can be resolved during implementation with documented defaults.

---

### Optional (Improve Specification)

If specification is being revised, recommend adding:

1. **Filename Truncation:** Add explicit truncation strategy (80 chars, basename preferred)
2. **Real-Time Latency:** Define latency thresholds (<1000ms end-to-end)
3. **Performance Criteria:** Define "jank" as <60fps or >100ms delays
4. **Time Estimate Fallback:** Specify "Estimating..." when unavailable

**Impact of Not Adding:** Low - Implementer will make reasonable choices, document in code

---

### During Implementation

For each MEDIUM issue, document resolution in code:

```rust
// REQ-AIA-UI-004: Filename truncation
// Strategy: Show basename only if full path >80 characters
// Rationale: Basename most informative, avoids UI clutter
```

```javascript
// REQ-AIA-UI-002: Real-time update threshold
// Latency target: <1000ms per AC-007, <100ms UI update
// Throttle: Max 10 updates/sec per REQ-AIA-UI-NF-001
```
