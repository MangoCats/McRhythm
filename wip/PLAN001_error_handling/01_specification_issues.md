## MEDIUM Priority Issues (4)

### ISSUE-M-001: Database Schema for Unsupported Codec Marking

**Affected Requirement:** REQ-AP-ERR-011 (Unsupported codecs marked to prevent re-queue)

**Location:** SPEC021 line 150, ERH-DEC-020

**Issue:**
Specification states "Mark passage as 'unsupported_codec' in database" but doesn't specify:
- Which table (passages, queue, or new table?)
- Which field/column (status enum? boolean flag? separate table?)
- Field data type and values

**Current Text:**
```
3. Mark passage as "unsupported_codec" in database (prevent re-enqueueing)
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Implementer must design schema change
- Risk of inconsistent approaches across different implementations
- May require database migration

**Recommended Resolution:**

**Option A - Status Enum (Recommended):**  Mango Cat: concur, use Option A
```sql
-- Add to passages table
ALTER TABLE passages ADD COLUMN decode_status TEXT
  CHECK(decode_status IN ('unknown', 'supported', 'unsupported_codec', 'truncated'))
  DEFAULT 'unknown';
```

**Option B - Boolean Flag:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE passages ADD COLUMN is_unsupported BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Option C - Separate Tracking Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE passage_decode_status (
  passage_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES passages(passage_id),
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_error TEXT,
  last_attempt TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (status enum) in passages table for simplicity and queryability.

**Resolution Status:** Will resolve during implementation - add to implementation notes.

### ISSUE-M-002: Buffer Underrun Timeout Configuration Inconsistency

**Affected Requirement:** REQ-AP-ERR-020 (Buffer underrun emergency refill with 500ms timeout)

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 289, 305-309, ERH-BUF-015

**Issue:**
Specification states:
- Default timeout: **500ms**
- But also states: "Longer than typical decode_work_period (default **5000ms**)"
- **Logic conflict:** 500ms < 5000ms, so timeout is SHORTER than decode period, not longer

**Current Text:**
```
4. Emergency buffer refill:
   - Wait up to buffer_underrun_recovery_timeout_ms for buffer to reach mixer_min_start_level
   - Default timeout: 500ms (configurable via database settings table)

[ERH-BUF-015]
- Default: 500ms
- Rationale: Timeout must be:
  - Shorter than user perception threshold (~1 second)
  - Longer than typical decode_work_period (default 5000ms) ← CONFLICT
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- If timeout is 500ms and decode period is 5000ms, emergency refill will ALWAYS timeout
- This defeats the purpose of emergency refill
- Likely typo or outdated value

**Analysis:**

If decode_work_period is indeed 5000ms (5 seconds):
- 500ms timeout is too short (won't complete even one decode cycle)
- Underrun recovery will fail immediately

**Recommended Resolution:**

**Option 1: Increase default timeout** (most likely intent)  Mango Cat: verified, this is the intent.
```
Default: 2000ms (2 seconds)
Range: 1000ms - 10000ms
Rationale:
- Allows at least one partial decode cycle
- Still under user perception threshold
- Platform-specific tuning needed (Pi Zero 2W may need 5000ms)
```

**Option 2: Clarify decode_work_period is actually shorter** (if typo)
```
If decode_work_period is actually 200-500ms, then 500ms timeout is reasonable
```

**Recommendation:** Verify actual decode_work_period from Phase 4 implementation, then adjust timeout default accordingly. Flag for Phase 8 performance validation.

**Resolution Status:** **NOTED FOR PHASE 8** - Specification acknowledges validation needed. Implement with 500ms default, measure actual decode period, adjust if needed.

### ISSUE-M-003: Position Resync Mechanism Unspecified

**Affected Requirement:** REQ-AP-ERR-060 (Position drift <100 samples auto-corrected)

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 650-651, ERH-TIME-020

**Issue:**
Specification says "Resync decoder position to expected" but doesn't specify HOW:
- Does resync mean seek to expected position?
- Adjust internal sample counter?
- Recreate decoder from expected position?
- Just log and continue (accepting drift)?

**Current Text:**
```
3. If delta >= 100 samples:
   - Emit PositionDriftWarning event
   - Resync decoder position to expected  ← HOW?
   - Continue playback
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Implementer must choose resync approach
- Different approaches have different audio implications
- No guidance on trade-offs

**Recommended Resolution:**

Clarify resync mechanism:
```
3. If delta >= 100 samples:
   - Emit PositionDriftWarning event
   - Resync mechanism:
     a. Adjust internal sample counter to expected position (preferred - no audio glitch)
     b. If audio corruption suspected, flush buffer and seek to expected position
   - Continue playback
```

**Rationale:**
- Counter adjustment is fastest (no seeking, no audio glitch)
- Only seek if drift indicates actual audio corruption (rare)

**Resolution Status:** Will resolve during implementation - prefer counter adjustment unless corruption detected.

### ISSUE-M-004: Event Definition Integration with wkmp-common

**Affected Requirements:** REQ-AP-EVENT-ERR-010, REQ-AP-EVENT-ERR-020

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 740-902, ERH-EVENT-010

**Issue:**
Specification defines **25 new WkmpEvent variants** to add to SPEC011/wkmp-common but:
- Doesn't verify current wkmp-common events structure can accommodate
- Doesn't specify migration strategy if existing events conflict
- Assumes SPEC011 will be updated (requires separate spec update)

**Current Text:**
```rust
/// Error events for audio player failures
pub enum WkmpEvent {
    // ... existing events ...

    // 25 new variants added
}
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Need to verify wkmp-common::events::WkmpEvent enum exists and is extensible
- May require SPEC011 update
- May require wkmp-common version bump
- Backward compatibility considerations

**Recommended Resolution:**

**Pre-Implementation Verification:**
1. Read wkmp-common/src/events.rs to verify WkmpEvent enum structure
2. Check if any proposed event names conflict with existing events
3. Verify all field types are available (DateTime<Utc>, Uuid, etc.)
4. If conflicts found, resolve before implementation

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add new variants to wkmp-common::events::WkmpEvent
2. Update SPEC011 to document new events
3. Version bump wkmp-common if needed
4. Verify SSE serialization works for new events

**Resolution Status:** Will resolve during implementation - verify wkmp-common structure first, then add events incrementally with tests.

## LOW Priority Issues (3)

### ISSUE-L-001: Buffer Overflow Listed as Error Condition

**Affected:** ERH-BUF-020 (not a requirement, just specification section)

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 320-346

**Issue:**
ERH-BUF-020 explicitly states "This is normal backpressure, not error condition" but is listed in error handling specification.

**Current Text:**
```
**Note:** This is normal backpressure, not error condition. Included for completeness.

**Traceability:** [SPEC016 DBD-BUF-050] (Buffer backpressure)
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Minimal - already correctly classified as normal operation
- May cause confusion about whether to implement error handling

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Move to separate "Normal Conditions" section, OR
- Remove from SPEC021 entirely (already covered in SPEC016)

**Resolution Status:** Accept as-is - "included for completeness" justification is reasonable. No action needed.

Mango Cat: for clarity, if a buffer overflow happens, that's not an error - as long as the audio data is properly handled, not thrown away, not duplicated, just buffered in the exact same order as it came out of the decoder.

---

### ISSUE-L-002: Tick Overflow Defensive Programming

**Affected:** ERH-TIME-010 (informational)

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 600-628

**Issue:**
Specification includes defensive handling for tick overflow (i64::MAX) which would take ~1 million years of continuous playback to reach.

**Current Text:**
```
**Note:** Defensive programming only - should never occur in practice.
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Adds code complexity for impossible condition
- But: Defensive programming is best practice

**Recommended Resolution:**
Accept as-is - defensive programming for overflow is reasonable Rust practice, even if condition is impossible in reality.

Mango Cat: concur, stay with defensive programming.

**Resolution Status:** No action needed - specification appropriately notes this is defensive.

---

### ISSUE-L-003: Degradation Mode Recovery Times

**Affected:** ERH-DEGRADE-010, ERH-DEGRADE-020

**Location:** SPEC021 lines 1035, 1043

**Issue:**
Recovery times appear somewhat arbitrary:
- Mode 1 (Reduced Chain Count): 5 minutes
- Mode 2 (Single Passage): 10 minutes

No rationale provided for these specific durations.

**Current Text:**
```
- Recovery: Reset to full chain count after 5 minutes without errors
- Recovery: Re-enable after 10 minutes of stable playback
```

**Impact on Implementation:**
- Minimal - values are reasonable
- May want to make configurable in future

**Recommended Resolution:**
Accept current values but consider making configurable via settings table in future enhancement.

Mango Cat: prefer to make configurable via settings table now.

**Resolution Status:** No action needed - values are reasonable defaults.
