I want to /plan a change to the workflows and project decision making biases that institutes these values in the system:

Don't be sycophantic: don't bias your opinions and ratings based on what the user seems to want.  Be objective, base weightings and ratings on unbiased sources and data.

Don't be lazy: when a plan calls for six steps, implement the six steps or provide clear reasoning why a step should be skipped and STOP to ask for approval to skip the step.  Don't report "PLAN COMPLETE" or "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" without actually completing the plan.  Every plan final report should include clear, unambiguous statements of what was and what was not done from the original plan.

Don't be in a hurry: implement to complete plans, not to shortcut to a partial implementation.

Don't hide problems or technical debt: highlight them, work to find them early and report them clearly and accurately.  Every "plan execution final report" must include a thorough review for and reporting of technical debt and known problems.\

## After Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-30
**Analysis Method:** `/think` Multi-Agent Workflow (8-Phase Analysis)
**Analysis Output:** [_attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md](_attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md)

### Quick Summary

**Current State:**
- Existing Risk-First Framework provides structural objectivity (addresses anti-sycophancy partially)
- Plan completion checklist exists but is advisory only (no enforcement)
- NO technical debt reporting standards exist anywhere (critical gap)

**Critical Gaps Identified:** 4
1. **Professional Objectivity** - No explicit standard for disagreeing with user when necessary
2. **Plan Execution Completion** - No enforcement, no "what was/wasn't done" reporting requirement
3. **No-Shortcut Implementation** - Implicit in risk framework, not explicit standard
4. **Technical Debt Reporting** - Completely absent (CRITICAL - highest risk)

**Approaches Analyzed:** 3
1. **Comprehensive Rewrite** - High effectiveness, but High risk, 80-120 hours effort
2. **Targeted Standards Enhancement** - High effectiveness, Low risk, 15-25 hours effort ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
3. **Lightweight Checklist** - Low-Medium effectiveness, Medium risk, 2-4 hours effort (inadequate for technical debt)

**Recommendation:** Approach 2 (Targeted Standards Enhancement)
- Add "Professional Objectivity" section to CLAUDE.md (~75 lines)
- Add "Plan Execution and Completion Standards" to plan.md (~250 lines)
- Add "Phase 9: Post-Implementation Review" to plan.md (~300 lines) - comprehensive technical debt discovery process
- Update Phase 8 plan documentation requirements (~50 lines)
- Total: ~675 lines of new standards, 15-25 hours effort, Low residual risk

**Key Recommendation Rationale:**
- Lowest residual risk (Low) among effective approaches
- Addresses all four gaps comprehensively (including critical technical debt gap)
- Minimal disruption to working patterns (builds on existing successful framework)
- Acceptable timeline (2-3 weeks vs. 2-3 months for rewrite)
- Technical debt gap MUST be addressed with proper process (checklist insufficient)

**See full analysis document for:**
- Detailed gap analysis for each of 4 values
- Complete risk assessment for 3 approaches
- Recommended section structures and templates
- Technical debt discovery process details
- Comparison matrix and implementation guidance

**Next Step:** Review analysis, select approach, then run `/plan _attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md` to create implementation plan
