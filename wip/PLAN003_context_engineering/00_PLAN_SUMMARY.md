# PLAN003: Context Engineering Implementation - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Project:** WKMP Music Player - Context Engineering Improvements
**Plan ID:** PLAN003
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Source Specification:** [wip/context_engineering_analysis_results.md](../context_engineering_analysis_results.md)
**Planning Method:** `/plan` workflow (Phases 1-3 complete)

---

## READ THIS FIRST (5-minute overview)

**What We're Implementing:**
Phase 1 and Phase 2 recommendations from context engineering analysis to address:
1. **Problem 1:** AI implementations overlooking specifications
2. **Problem 2:** AI-authored documents too verbose/bloated

**Why It Matters:**
Research confirms: "Most agent failures are context failures." WKMP needs optimized context engineering to scale effectively.

**Effort:** 21.5-28.5 hours total (Phase 1: 13.5-17.5 hours, Phase 2: 8-11 hours)

**Timeline:** 4 weeks (Phase 1: weeks 1-2, Phase 2: weeks 3-4)

**Expected Impact:**
- 20-40% reduction in document size (research-backed)
- Proactive specification verification via mandatory `/plan` workflow
- Gradual improvement as new modular docs created

## Quick Navigation

| Section | Purpose | Lines | When to Read |
|---------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **This Summary** | Quick overview + roadmap | <500 | **Always start here** |
| **[requirements_index.md](requirements_index.md)** | All 16 requirements | ~150 | When clarifying scope |
| **[scope_statement.md](scope_statement.md)** | In/out scope, constraints | ~300 | Before implementation |
| **[dependencies_map.md](dependencies_map.md)** | Files, tools, team needs | ~350 | Before starting sessions |
| **[01_specification_issues.md](01_specification_issues.md)** | 7 issues (3 HIGH) | ~400 | Before addressing decisions |
| **[02_test_specifications/](02_test_specifications/)** | 23 tests, traceability | ~200 (index) | During implementation |

**Total context for implementation:** Summary + scope + requirements = ~600-800 lines

## Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Implementation Overlooks Specifications

**Root Causes:**
- Context window overload (specs too large to load entirely)
- Information scattered across multiple documents
- No systematic requirement traceability enforcement

**Solution:** Mandate `/plan` workflow for all non-trivial features
- Phase 2: Specification Completeness Verification (catch gaps BEFORE coding)
- Phase 3: Acceptance Test Definition (test-first, 100% coverage via traceability matrix)
- Automatic `/think` integration if complexity detected

**Expected Outcome:** Catch specification issues BEFORE implementation → reduce rework

---

### Problem 2: AI-Authored Documents Are Bloated

**Root Causes:**
- AI defaults to verbose, comprehensive output
- No explicit conciseness constraints in older workflows
- Progressive disclosure pattern not consistently applied

**Solutions:**
1. **Verbosity Constraints:** Add to CLAUDE.md + all workflows (target 20-40% reduction)
2. **Summary-First Reading:** Mandate "read summary → drill down" pattern
3. **Modular Structure:** Require for all new docs >300 lines

**Expected Outcome:** Smaller, clearer documents → better context window usage

---

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Weeks 1-2)

**4 Interventions:**

**1C: Mandate `/plan` Workflow** (3 hours)
- Update CLAUDE.md with mandatory policy
- Create workshop materials
- Conduct 2-hour team workshop
- Pilot `/plan` on one feature

**2A: Explicit Verbosity Constraints** (2.5-3.5 hours)
- Add "Document Generation Verbosity Standards" to CLAUDE.md
- Update 6 workflows with size targets
- Target: 20-40% reduction (start conservative at 20%)

**2D: Summary-First Reading Pattern** (2.5 hours)
- Add "Documentation Reading Protocol" to CLAUDE.md
- Update 6 workflows with reading guidance
- Pattern: summary first, drill down to details only when needed

**2B: Mandatory Modular Structure** (8-11 hours)
- Update GOV001 (draft for Phase 2 approval)
- Update `/doc-name` workflow (size checking)
- Create 3 template files
- Thresholds: >300 lines (summary required), >1200 lines (modular folder structure)

**Total Phase 1: 13.5-17.5 hours**

---

### Phase 2 (Near-term - Weeks 3-4)

**GOV001 Formalization** (8-11 hours)
- Draft GOV001 "Document Size and Structure Standards" section
- Review with Technical Lead + Documentation Lead (per GOV001 governance)
- Team consensus (per GOV001 for major changes)
- Approve and commit via `/commit`
- Conduct 2-hour team education session

**Monitoring** (included in above)
- Collect document size metrics (baseline + ongoing)
- Track `/plan` usage
- Collect team feedback (survey)
- Decision: Proceed to Phase 3 (refactoring) or stop?

**Total Phase 2: 8-11 hours**

---

## Specification Issues (Decisions Required)

**Found:** 7 issues (0 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)

**HIGH-Priority Decisions Needed:**

1. **ISSUE-H-001: Mandatory `/plan` Threshold**
   - **Decision:** >5 requirements? >10? Team discretion?
   - **Recommendation:** >5 requirements OR novel/complex features
   - **Impact:** Defines when `/plan` mandatory

2. **ISSUE-H-002: Verbosity Constraint Aggressiveness**
   - **Decision:** How aggressive to be? Risk of excessive terseness?
   - **Recommendation:** Start conservative (20% target), refine iteratively
   - **Impact:** Balances conciseness vs. clarity

3. **ISSUE-H-003: Legacy Document Migration Strategy**
   - **Decision:** Refactor now or wait for Phase 1-2 results?
   - **Recommendation:** Wait, measure metrics, decide at end of Phase 2
   - **Impact:** Scope of future work (10-68 hours if Phase 3 triggered)

**Action:** Schedule 1-hour stakeholder meeting to resolve these 3 decisions before starting implementation.

**See:** [01_specification_issues.md](01_specification_issues.md) for all 7 issues and resolutions

## Key Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Team Resistance to Changes** (Medium probability, Medium impact)
- **Mitigation:** Education, pilot program, iterative refinement
- **Contingency:** Adjust constraint levels based on feedback

**Risk 2: GOV001 Update Rejected** (Low probability, Medium impact)
- **Mitigation:** Demonstrate Phase 1 success first, thorough proposal
- **Contingency:** Phase 1 still valuable even if Phase 2 blocked

**Risk 3: Workshop Low Attendance** (Medium probability, Low impact)
- **Mitigation:** Schedule ≥2 weeks advance, record session
- **Contingency:** Require recording viewing within 1 week

**Risk 4: Quality Degradation from Verbosity Constraints** (Low probability, High impact)
- **Mitigation:** Start conservative (20%), monitor feedback, examples in prompts
- **Contingency:** Roll back constraints if quality drops

**See:** [scope_statement.md](scope_statement.md) lines 380-415 for complete risk analysis

---

## Out of Scope (Phase 3 - Deferred)

**NOT in this plan:**
- ❌ Refactoring legacy documents (GOV001, SPEC001, REQ001, etc.)
- ❌ Hierarchical context loading implementation
- ❌ Automated traceability verification tooling
- ❌ Any code implementation (Rust, microservices)

**Rationale:** High effort (10-68 hours), defer until Phase 1-2 proven insufficient

**Phase 3 Trigger Criteria:**
- Document size reduction <15% OR
- Team satisfaction <50% OR
- Context window issues persist despite new workflows

## Implementation Guide

### For Implementer (AI or Human)

**What to Read:**
1. **This summary** (~400 lines) - Always start here
2. **[scope_statement.md](scope_statement.md)** (~300 lines) - Understand boundaries
3. **[requirements_index.md](requirements_index.md)** (~150 lines) - All requirements
4. **[dependencies_map.md](dependencies_map.md)** (~350 lines) - Before each session
5. **Specific test specs** (~100 lines each) - During implementation

**Total context per session:** ~600-800 lines (not 2000+)

**Do NOT read:**
- FULL_PLAN.md (if created - archival only)
- All 23 test specs at once (read only relevant tests)

### Execution Pattern

**For each requirement:**
1. Read requirement from requirements_index.md
2. Read relevant test spec(s) from 02_test_specifications/
3. Implement to pass tests
4. Run tests (automated or manual)
5. Commit via `/commit` when tests pass
6. Update traceability matrix "Status" column (Pending → In Progress → Complete)

**For each session:**
1. Read 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md (this file)
2. Read session-specific requirements
3. Load dependencies from dependencies_map.md
4. Implement and test
5. Commit
6. Document completion

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Before Starting):**
1. **Schedule stakeholder meeting** (1 hour) to resolve 3 HIGH issues
   - ISSUE-H-001: `/plan` threshold
   - ISSUE-H-002: Verbosity constraint level
   - ISSUE-H-003: Legacy document migration strategy

2. **Verify file access:**
   - CLAUDE.md readable/writable
   - GOV001 readable/writable
   - All 6 workflows readable/writable
   - templates/ folder writable (or creatable)

3. **Schedule workshop:**
   - 2-hour block
