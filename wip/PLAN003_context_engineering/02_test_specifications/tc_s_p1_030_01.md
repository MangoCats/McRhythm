## Test Procedure

### Pre-Workshop (1 week before)

**Setup:**
1. Schedule workshop (2-hour block)
2. Send calendar invite to development team
3. Prepare materials (per TC-S-P1-020-01)
4. Reserve meeting space
5. Prepare attendance sheet
6. Prepare exit survey (3-5 questions)

**Attendance Sheet Template:**
```
=/plan WORKFLOW WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Time: [HH:MM - HH:MM]
Facilitator: [Name]

Attendees:
Name                | Signature       | Role
--------------------|-----------------|------------------
[Team Member 1]     | ___________    | Developer
[Team Member 2]     | ___________    | Developer
[etc.]

Recording: [Yes/No]
Recording Link: [URL if virtual]

Notes:
- [Any special circumstances]
```

### Workshop Execution (2 hours)

**Part 1 (45 min): `/plan` Overview**
- Present slides
- Explain context from analysis
- Demo `/plan` on simple example
- Q&A

**Checkpoint:** All attendees understand `/plan` purpose (ask for confirmation)

**Part 2 (45 min): Hands-On Practice**
- Divide into pairs/small groups
- Work through example specification
- Practice identifying spec issues
- Practice defining acceptance tests
- Share findings

**Checkpoint:** All groups complete exercise (or run out of time gracefully)

**Part 3 (30 min): Integration and Next Steps**
- Review mandatory `/plan` usage policy
- Discuss when to use `/plan`
- Select pilot feature (team discussion)
- Explain feedback mechanisms
- Administer exit survey

**Checkpoint:** Pilot feature selected and documented

### Post-Workshop (within 1 week)

**Verification:**
1. Collect attendance sheet
2. Collect exit surveys
3. Calculate attendance rate
4. Calculate average satisfaction score
5. Document pilot feature selection
6. Share recording link with absentees (if recorded)
7. Follow up with absentees (confirm they watch recording)

**Documentation:**
- Store attendance sheet in project_management/ folder
- Add workshop completion entry to change_history.md (via /commit)
- Document pilot feature in wip/PLAN003_context_engineering/pilot_feature.md

## Test Data

**Input:**
- Workshop materials (slides, handouts, example spec)
- Attendance sheet template
- Exit survey (3-5 questions)

**Example Exit Survey:**
```
/plan Workflow Workshop - Feedback

1. I understand the purpose of the /plan workflow.
   [ ] Strongly Disagree  [ ] Disagree  [ ] Neutral  [ ] Agree  [ ] Strongly Agree

2. I feel confident using /plan for my next feature.
   [ ] Strongly Disagree  [ ] Disagree  [ ] Neutral  [ ] Agree  [ ] Strongly Agree

3. The hands-on practice was helpful.
   [ ] Strongly Disagree  [ ] Disagree  [ ] Neutral  [ ] Agree  [ ] Strongly Agree

4. Overall, how would you rate this workshop?
   [ ] 1 - Poor  [ ] 2  [ ] 3 - Neutral  [ ] 4  [ ] 5 - Excellent

5. What should we improve for future workshops?

**Expected Output:**
- Completed attendance sheet (75%+ attendance)
- 10+ completed exit surveys (if team size ~12-15)
- Average satisfaction ≥3.5/5
- Pilot feature documented

## Pass Conditions (Detailed)

**Minimum Requirements:**
- ✅ ≥75% team attendance (in-person or recorded)
- ✅ Attendance sheet completed and filed
- ✅ All 3 workshop parts completed
- ✅ Pilot feature selected
- ✅ Average exit survey score ≥3/5

**Ideal Conditions (Nice to Have):**
- ✨ 100% attendance
- ✨ Average exit survey score ≥4/5
- ✨ Enthusiastic pilot feature discussion
- ✨ Team requests additional training

**Conditional Pass (Acceptable):**
- ⚠️ 50-74% attendance IF remaining team watches recording within 1 week
- ⚠️ Average score 2.5-3/5 IF specific improvements identified and addressed

**Fail Conditions (Must Re-Run Workshop):**
- ❌ <50% attendance (even with recording)
- ❌ Workshop not completed (canceled, cut short)
- ❌ No pilot feature selected
- ❌ Average score <2.5/5 (major issues)

---

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Attendance rate: ≥75% (target 85%+)
- Exit survey score: ≥3/5 (target 4/5)
- Recording views (if applicable): 100% of absentees within 1 week

**Qualitative:**
- Team understands `/plan` purpose
- Team feels confident using `/plan`
- Pilot feature selection demonstrates understanding
- Positive team sentiment

---

## Dependencies

**Upstream:**
- REQ-CE-P1-020 (materials prepared)
- TC-S-P1-020-01 (materials quality verified)
- Team availability (scheduled in advance)

**Downstream:**
- Pilot `/plan` usage (depends on workshop success)
- REQ-CE-MON-020 (tracks `/plan` adoption - workshop trains team)

---

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Attendance**
- **Mitigation:** Schedule ≥2 weeks in advance, multiple time slots polled
- **Contingency:** Record session, require viewing within 1 week

**Risk 2: Technical Issues (Virtual Workshop)**
- **Mitigation:** Test video/screen sharing 1 day before, backup plan
- **Contingency:** Reschedule if critical issues, document incident

**Risk 3: Materials Unclear**
- **Mitigation:** Pre-review with 1-2 team members, iterate
- **Contingency:** Additional Q&A session, updated materials

**Risk 4: No Pilot Feature Candidates**
- **Mitigation:** Identify 2-3 candidates before workshop
- **Contingency:** Use backlog item or synthetic example

---

## Notes

**Rationale for System Test:**
- Workshop is user-facing activity (team interaction)
- Success depends on human factors (engagement, comprehension)
- Integration of materials, delivery, and outcomes

**Known Limitations:**
- Cannot guarantee comprehension (only measure proxy: survey scores)
- Cannot force attendance (organizational constraint)
- Recording viewing not verifiable (honor system)

**Design Decisions:**
- 75% attendance threshold (realistic for teams, allows illness/vacation)
- 3/5 survey score (middle-ground, allows for improvement)
- Pilot feature selection (demonstrates practical understanding)

**Best Practices:**
- Send materials 1 day early (preview opportunity)
- Record virtual sessions (asynchronous learning)
- Follow up with absentees (ensure coverage)
- Document lessons learned (improve future workshops)
