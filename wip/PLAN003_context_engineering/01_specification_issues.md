## Issues by Severity

### CRITICAL Issues (Blocking Implementation)

**None identified.** Specification is sufficiently complete to begin implementation.

---

### HIGH Issues (High Risk Without Resolution)

#### ISSUE-H-001: Mandatory `/plan` Usage Threshold Not Quantified

**Category:** Ambiguity
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-P1-010
**Source:** analysis_results.md line 98

**Description:**
Specification states "Mandate `/plan` workflow for all non-trivial features (>5 requirements)" but lists this as a decision point. Analysis presents three options:
- >5 requirements
- >10 requirements
- Team discretion

**Impact:**
- Implementation cannot write specific threshold into CLAUDE.md without decision
- Different team members may interpret "non-trivial" differently
- `/plan` adoption rate unpredictable

**Current Wording:**
> "Mandatory `/plan` Usage Threshold? (>5 requirements? >10? Team discretion?)"

**Recommendation:**
**Option A (Recommended):** Use >5 requirements threshold
- **Rationale:** Low barrier encourages adoption, aligns with "non-trivial" definition
- **CLAUDE.md Wording:** "For all features requiring >5 requirements OR novel/complex features"

**Option B:** Use >10 requirements threshold
- **Rationale:** Higher bar, reduces overhead for medium features
- **Risk:** May miss features that would benefit from `/plan`

**Option C:** Team discretion
- **Rationale:** Flexibility, trust team judgment
- **Risk:** Inconsistent adoption, defeats "mandatory" intent

**Proposed Resolution:**
- **Stakeholder decision required** before implementing REQ-CE-P1-010
- Recommend Option A (>5 requirements) based on analysis research
- Document chosen threshold in CLAUDE.md

**Test Impact:**
- Acceptance tests will verify CLAUDE.md contains specific threshold (whatever chosen)
- No test can validate "correct" threshold (subjective)

---

#### ISSUE-H-002: Verbosity Constraint Aggressiveness Level Undefined

**Category:** Ambiguity
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-P1-040
**Source:** analysis_results.md line 99

**Description:**
Specification provides verbosity guidelines ("20-40% shorter", "one concept per sentence") but lists "How aggressive?" as decision point.

**Impact:**
- Risk of being too terse (clarity suffers)
- Risk of being too lenient (problem persists)
- Team may resist if constraints feel excessive

**Current Guidance:**
- Target: 20-40% reduction (research-backed)
- Examples provided (good)
- Stylistic rules defined (good)

**Ambiguity:**
> "Verbosity Constraint Level? (How aggressive? Risk of excessive terseness?)"

**Recommendation:**
**Start Conservative, Refine Iteratively:**

**Phase 1 (Initial):**
- Target: 20% reduction (lower end of range)
- Emphasize clarity: "Be concise WITHOUT sacrificing clarity"
- Provide positive examples (not just prohibitions)

**Phase 2 (Refinement - Week 3-4):**
- Measure actual reduction achieved
- Collect team feedback on clarity
- Adjust target up to 40% if quality maintained

**Proposed Wording for CLAUDE.md:**
```
**Target:** 20-40% shorter than comprehensive first draft (aim for 20% initially)
**Priority:** Clarity first, then conciseness
**If in doubt:** Err on side of clarity
```

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Implement conservative constraints initially
- Monitor metrics (size reduction + quality feedback)
- Refine based on data (Week 3-4)

**Test Impact:**
- Acceptance tests will verify constraints exist in CLAUDE.md
- Quality assessment requires human review (not automatable)

#### ISSUE-H-003: Legacy Document Migration Strategy Unspecified

**Category:** Missing Information
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-P2-010 (indirectly)
**Source:** analysis_results.md line 100

**Description:**
Specification defers legacy document refactoring to Phase 3 (conditional) but doesn't define:
- Criteria for triggering Phase 3
- Which documents to prioritize if Phase 3 triggered
- Timeline for refactoring if approved

**Impact:**
- Phase 2 GOV001 update may conflict with legacy documents (monolithic vs. modular)
- Team may expect immediate refactoring of GOV001 itself (997 lines)
- Unclear what happens if Phase 1-2 metrics are "mixed" (some good, some bad)

**Decision Point (from spec):**
> "Legacy Document Migration Strategy? (Refactor now or wait for Phase 1-2 results?)"

**Recommendation:**
**Wait-and-Measure Approach (Recommended):**

**Phase 1-2 Success Criteria (Week 4):**
- If document size reduced ≥20% AND team satisfaction ≥75% → Phase 3 NOT needed
- If document size reduced <15% OR team satisfaction <50% → Phase 3 required
- If mixed results → Selective refactoring (top 3 documents only)

**Phase 3 Trigger Criteria:**
1. Context window issues persist (AI still missing specs)
2. New modular docs significantly more usable (measurable time-to-find-info)
3. Stakeholder approval of 10-68 hour refactoring effort

**Prioritization (If Phase 3 Triggered):**
1. GOV001 (997 lines, most-referenced)
2. SPEC001 (architecture, foundational)
3. REQ001 (requirements, authoritative)

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Document Phase 3 trigger criteria in scope_statement.md (already done)
- Measure metrics in Week 3-4
- Make data-driven decision at end of Phase 2
- **Do NOT refactor legacy docs in Phase 1-2**

**Test Impact:**
- No tests for Phase 3 (out of scope for this plan)
- Phase 2 tests will verify GOV001 updated (new section added)
- Acceptance: GOV001 can coexist with legacy monolithic documents

### MEDIUM Issues (Should Resolve, Can Work Around)

#### ISSUE-M-001: GOV001 Update Authority Process Not Detailed

**Category:** Missing Procedure
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-P2-020
**Source:** GOV001 lines 82-88

**Description:**
Specification states GOV001 update requires "review by technical lead and documentation lead" and "major changes require team consensus" but doesn't specify:
- How is review requested? (Email? Meeting? PR?)
- How is consensus measured? (Vote? Discussion? Approval threshold?)
- How long is review expected to take?
- What if leads disagree?

**Impact:**
- Phase 2 timeline uncertain (could be 1 day or 2 weeks)
- Implementation may stall waiting for approvals
- Conflict resolution process unclear

**Current Guidance (GOV001:82-88):**
> "Changes require review by technical lead and doc lead"
> "Major changes (new tiers, flow rules) require team consensus"

**Proposed Resolution:**
**Document Lightweight Review Process:**

**For Phase 2 GOV001 Update:**
1. **Prepare draft:** REQ-CE-P2-010 (2-3 hours)
2. **Request review:** Email/PR to Technical Lead + Documentation Lead with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Rationale (link to analysis_results.md)
   - Phase 1 metrics (demonstrate success)
3. **Review period:** 3-5 business days
4. **Team consensus:** Present at team meeting, discussion + informal vote
5. **Approval threshold:** >50% team support, no strong objections from leads
6. **Commit:** Use `/commit` workflow

**Timeline Estimate:**
- Draft: 2-3 hours
- Review: 3-5 days
- Meeting: 1 hour
- Revisions (if any): 1-2 hours
- **Total:** ~1 week from draft to commit

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Add review process details to scope_statement.md (note: not done yet, will add)
- Include timeline buffer in Phase 2 schedule
- Identify Technical Lead and Documentation Lead early

**Test Impact:**
- Acceptance test: GOV001 committed to repository (implies approval obtained)
- Process adherence not automatable

---

#### ISSUE-M-002: Workshop Content Not Defined

**Category:** Missing Detail
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-P1-020, 030
**Source:** Implied by workshop requirement

**Description:**
Specification requires 2-hour `/plan` workshop but doesn't specify:
- What topics to cover
- What materials to prepare
- What outcomes to achieve
- Who presents/facilitates

**Impact:**
- Workshop may be ineffective (team doesn't understand `/plan`)
- Inconsistent adoption if training incomplete
- Preparation time unknown

**Proposed Resolution:**
**Workshop Content Outline:**

**Part 1 (45 minutes): `/plan` Workflow Overview**
- Why `/plan` workflow (context from analysis)
- 8-phase workflow walkthrough
- Demo: Run `/plan` on simple example
- Q&A

**Part 2 (45 minutes): Hands-On Practice**
- Teams work through example specification
- Practice identifying spec issues
- Practice defining acceptance tests
- Share findings

**Part 3 (30 minutes): Integration and Next Steps**
- When to use `/plan` (mandatory threshold)
- How to use `/plan` output (read summary first)
- Pilot feature selection
- Feedback mechanisms

**Materials Needed:**
- Slides (15-20 slides)
- Example specification (simple feature, 5-10 requirements)
- `/plan` workflow quick reference (1-page handout)

**Facilitator:** Implementation lead (person running `/plan` implementation)

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Create workshop materials during REQ-CE-P1-020 implementation
- Test materials with one person before workshop
- Record session for absentees

**Test Impact:**
- Acceptance test: Workshop completed (attendance sheet)
- Effectiveness measured by pilot success rate

#### ISSUE-M-003: Metrics Collection Method Undefined

**Category:** Missing Procedure
**Affected Requirements:** REQ-CE-MON-010, 020, 030
**Source:** scope_statement.md lines 1155-1159

**Description:**
Specification requires metrics collection but doesn't specify:
- How to measure document size (lines? words? characters?)
- How to track `/plan` usage (manual log? automated?)
- How to collect team feedback (survey tool? retrospective?)
- Who is responsible for metrics collection?

**Impact:**
- Metrics may be inconsistent or incomplete
- Comparison difficult (baseline vs. post-implementation)
- Phase 3 decision lacks data

**Proposed Resolution:**
**Metrics Collection Plan:**

**Document Size Metrics:**
- **Measure:** Line count (wc -l)
- **Scope:** All new documents created after Phase 1 start (dated ≥ implementation date)
- **Frequency:** Weekly snapshot (every Friday)
- **Baseline:** Average lines per document from last 4 weeks (pre-Phase 1)
- **Target:** 20-40% reduction from baseline
- **Responsibility:** Implementation lead

**`/plan` Usage Metrics:**
- **Measure:** Count of features using `/plan` vs. features implemented
- **Scope:** All feature implementations (>5 requirements if threshold adopted)
- **Frequency:** Continuous tracking (log in change_history.md)
- **Target:** ≥80% of applicable features
- **Responsibility:** Development team (self-report)

**Team Feedback:**
- **Method:** Anonymous survey (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or similar)
- **Questions:**
  - Clarity: "Are documents clearer after verbosity constraints?" (1-5 scale)
  - Usability: "Is modular structure easier to navigate?" (1-5 scale)
  - Satisfaction: "Overall satisfaction with changes?" (1-5 scale)
  - Open feedback: "What should we improve?"
- **Frequency:** End of Phase 2 (Week 4)
- **Target:** ≥75% satisfaction (4-5 on scale)
- **Responsibility:** Implementation lead

**Proposed Resolution:**
- Document metrics plan in scope_statement.md (add section)
- Set up tracking spreadsheet (Week 1)
- Identify survey tool (Week 1)

**Test Impact:**
- Acceptance test: Metrics collected and documented
- Decision quality depends on metrics validity

## Specification Quality Assessment

**Overall:** Specification is **ADEQUATE** for implementation with minor clarifications.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear interventions defined with specific actions
- ✅ Research-backed rationale for all approaches
- ✅ Effort estimates provided
- ✅ Success metrics identified
- ✅ Phased approach well-structured

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ 3 HIGH-severity decision points require stakeholder input
- ⚠️ Metrics collection method needs definition
- ⚠️ Some procedural details missing (workshop content, review process)

**Testability:**
- ✅ Most requirements are testable (file exists, contains section, etc.)
- ⚠️ Quality/effectiveness metrics require human assessment

**Completeness:**
- ✅ Inputs defined (analysis document)
- ✅ Outputs defined (updated files, templates)
- ✅ Constraints acknowledged (GOV001 governance, team availability)
- ⚠️ Error cases not explicitly defined (what if workshop fails? what if GOV001 rejected?)

## Proceed to Implementation?

**Decision:** YES, with caveats

**Rationale:**
- No CRITICAL blocking issues
- HIGH issues are decision points (not missing technical info)
- Decisions can be made quickly with stakeholder input
- Remaining issues can be resolved during implementation

**Prerequisites Before Starting:**
1. **Stakeholder decisions on 3 HIGH issues** (can be done in 1-hour meeting)
2. **Workshop materials preparation** (during Week 1)
3. **Metrics tracking setup** (during Week 1)

**Estimated Delay:** None if decisions made promptly (1-2 days for stakeholder meeting)

---

**Specification Review Complete**
**Status:** Approved for implementation pending 3 decisions
**Next Phase:** Acceptance Test Definition (Phase 3)
