# Scope Statement: Context Engineering Implementation

**Project:** WKMP Music Player - Context Engineering Improvements
**Plan ID:** PLAN003
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Source:** [wip/context_engineering_analysis_results.md](../context_engineering_analysis_results.md)

## In Scope

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Week 1-2)

**Intervention 1C: Mandate `/plan` Workflow**
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md with mandatory `/plan` usage policy
- ✅ Create team education materials
- ✅ Conduct 2-hour team workshop
- ✅ Pilot `/plan` on one feature (track results)

**Intervention 2A: Explicit Verbosity Constraints**
- ✅ Add "Document Generation Verbosity Standards" section to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Update 6 workflow files (.claude/commands/*.md) with size targets:
  - commit.md
  - think.md
  - plan.md
  - doc-name.md
  - archive.md
  - archive-plan.md

**Intervention 2D: Summary-First Reading Pattern**
- ✅ Add "Documentation Reading Protocol" section to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Update 6 workflows with reading pattern guidance
- ✅ Provide good/bad examples in CLAUDE.md

**Intervention 2B: Modular Structure Mandate**
- ✅ Add "Document Size and Structure Standards" section to GOV001
- ✅ Update `/doc-name` workflow with size checking
- ✅ Create template files:
  - templates/modular_document/00_SUMMARY.md
  - templates/modular_document/01_section_template.md
  - templates/modular_document/README.md

### Phase 2 (Near-term - Week 2-4)

**GOV001 Formalization**
- ✅ Draft GOV001 update (formal process per GOV001 governance rules)
- ✅ Review with technical lead and documentation lead
- ✅ Approve and commit GOV001 changes
- ✅ Conduct 2-hour team education session

**Monitoring and Metrics**
- ✅ Establish baseline metrics (current document sizes, `/plan` usage)
- ✅ Monitor Phase 1 effectiveness (weeks 3-4)
- ✅ Collect team feedback
- ✅ Decision on Phase 3 (proceed or iterate)

---

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT in Phase 1-2

**Legacy Document Refactoring (Phase 3 - Conditional):**
- ❌ Refactoring GOV001-document_hierarchy.md (997 lines) into modular structure
- ❌ Refactoring SPEC001-architecture.md
- ❌ Refactoring REQ001-requirements.md
- ❌ Refactoring SPEC007-api_design.md
- ❌ Refactoring IMPL001-database_schema.md
- ❌ Any other legacy document restructuring

**Rationale:** High effort (10-68 hours total), deferred until Phase 1-2 proven insufficient

**Advanced Techniques (Phase 3 - Conditional):**
- ❌ Hierarchical Context Loading implementation (Approach 1B)
- ❌ Automated Traceability Verification tooling (Approach 1A)
- ❌ Dynamic context loading scripts

**Rationale:** Complex implementations, only if Phase 1-2 insufficient

**Specification Changes:**
- ❌ Changing `/think` or `/plan` workflow logic
- ❌ Modifying existing workflow behavior beyond adding constraints
- ❌ Altering GOV001 governance hierarchy (5-tier system)

**Code Implementation:**
- ❌ Writing Rust code
- ❌ Implementing new microservices
- ❌ Database schema changes

## Assumptions

1. **Team Availability:**
   - Team available for 2-hour workshop (Intervention 1C)
   - Team available for 2-hour education session (Phase 2)
   - Stakeholders available for GOV001 review (Phase 2)

2. **Tool Availability:**
   - `/plan` workflow exists and is functional (confirmed 2025-10-25)
   - `/think` workflow exists and is functional (confirmed 2025-10-25)
   - `/commit` workflow exists (confirmed in .claude/commands/)

3. **Authority:**
   - Authority to update CLAUDE.md (global AI instructions)
   - Authority to update workflow files in .claude/commands/
   - GOV001 update requires formal review per GOV001's own governance rules

4. **Baseline State:**
   - Current workflows (commit, doc-name, archive, archive-plan) do NOT have explicit size constraints
   - CLAUDE.md does NOT have verbosity standards or reading protocols
   - GOV001 does NOT have formal modular structure requirements (only in `/think` and `/plan` workflows)

5. **Success Metrics:**
   - 20-40% reduction in document size is achievable (research-backed)
   - `/plan` workflow adoption will occur if mandated in CLAUDE.md
   - Team will provide feedback if asked (survey/retrospective)

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

1. **File Format:** All documents are Markdown (.md)
2. **Encoding:** UTF-8 (existing issue with UTF-16 LE in some wip/ files)
3. **Version Control:** All changes tracked via git, use `/commit` workflow
4. **Workflow Platform:** Claude Code (not Cursor AI, though workflows adapted from Cursor)

### Process Constraints

1. **GOV001 Governance (Critical):**
   - Changes to GOV001 require review by technical lead and documentation lead (per GOV001 lines 82-88)
   - Major changes require team consensus (per GOV001 line 86)
   - This is a major change (new documentation standards), so team consensus required

2. **Change Control:**
   - All changes must be committed via `/commit` workflow
   - change_history.md updated automatically
   - No direct edits to protected files without workflow

3. **Documentation Hierarchy:**
   - Must respect WKMP 5-tier hierarchy (GOV001)
   - CLAUDE.md is root AI instruction (overrides defaults)
   - GOV001 is Tier 0 governance (affects all documentation)

### Schedule Constraints

1. **Phase 1:** 2 weeks (immediate start)
2. **Phase 2:** 2-4 weeks after Phase 1 start
3. **Phase 3 Decision:** End of Phase 2 (conditional)

**Rationale:** Low-effort interventions first, defer high-effort work until proven necessary

### Resource Constraints

1. **Effort Budget:**
   - Phase 1: 13.5-17.5 hours (must fit within available time)
   - Phase 2: 8-11 hours (additional)
   - Total: 21.5-28.5 hours for complete implementation

2. **Team Time:**
   - 2-hour workshop (Phase 1)
   - 2-hour education session (Phase 2)
   - Feedback collection (~30 minutes per team member)

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success (Measurable)

**After 2 weeks of Phase 1 implementation:**

1. **CLAUDE.md Updated:**
   - ✅ Contains "Document Generation Verbosity Standards" section
   - ✅ Contains "Documentation Reading Protocol" section
   - ✅ Contains "Implementation Workflow - MANDATORY" section

2. **Workflows Updated:**
   - ✅ All 6 workflow files contain size targets and reading guidance
   - ✅ `/doc-name` workflow checks document size and recommends structure

3. **Templates Created:**
   - ✅ Modular documentation templates exist in templates/ folder
   - ✅ README.md explains template usage

4. **Adoption:**
   - ✅ `/plan` workflow used for ≥1 feature (pilot)
   - ✅ Team trained (workshop completed)
   - ✅ Baseline metrics collected

5. **Metrics (Initial):**
   - ⏱️ Average new document size reduced by ≥15% (target 20-40%)
   - ⏱️ At least 1 feature planned using `/plan` workflow
   - ⏱️ No major issues reported with verbosity constraints

### Phase 2 Success (Measurable)

**After 4 weeks total (2 weeks Phase 2):**

1. **GOV001 Formalized:**
   - ✅ GOV001 updated with "Document Size and Structure Standards"
   - ✅ Reviewed and approved per governance process
   - ✅ Committed via `/commit` workflow

2. **Team Education:**
   - ✅ 2-hour session conducted
   - ✅ Team understands modular documentation pattern

3. **Metrics (Ongoing):**
   - ⏱️ Average new document size reduced by ≥20% (target 20-40%)
   - ⏱️ `/plan` usage: ≥3 features (if applicable)
   - ⏱️ Positive team feedback (≥75% satisfaction)
   - ⏱️ No documentation quality degradation

4. **Phase 3 Decision:**
   - ✅ Data-driven decision on whether to proceed with Phase 3 (refactoring)
   - ✅ Clear rationale documented

### Failure Criteria (Trigger Corrective Action)

1. **Document size NOT decreasing** (after 4 weeks)
2. **Team resistance high** (<50% satisfaction)
3. **Quality degradation** (clarity reduced, errors increased)
4. **`/plan` workflow not adopted** (<50% of applicable features)

**Corrective Actions:**
- Refine verbosity constraints (adjust aggressiveness)
- Additional team education
- Investigate root causes (AI not following, constraints too strict, etc.)

## Risks and Mitigation

### High-Level Risks

1. **Team Resistance** (Medium probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Education, pilot program, iterative refinement
   - Contingency: Adjust constraint levels based on feedback

2. **Quality Degradation** (Low probability, High impact)
   - Mitigation: Monitor metrics, user feedback, examples in prompts
   - Contingency: Roll back constraints if quality drops

3. **GOV001 Update Rejected** (Low probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Thorough proposal, demonstrate Phase 1 success first
   - Contingency: Phase 2B optional, Phase 1 still valuable

4. **Insufficient Time/Resources** (Low probability, Medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Effort estimates conservative, incremental approach
   - Contingency: Extend timeline, reduce scope to highest priority items
