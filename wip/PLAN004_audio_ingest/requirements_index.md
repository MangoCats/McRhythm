## Traceability to Parent Requirements

SPEC024 implements requirements from:
- **REQ001:281-306** - Import workflow requirements (REQ-PI-061 through REQ-PI-064)
- **SPEC008:32-510** - Library management workflows
- **SPEC025:1-654** - Amplitude analysis algorithms
- **IMPL001:172-247** - Database schema (passages.import_metadata)
- **IMPL005:1-end** - Audio file segmentation workflow

---

## Coverage Analysis

**Specification Coverage:**
- ✅ Microservices integration (wkmp-ui)
- ✅ Database access patterns
- ✅ Component architecture (9 modules)
- ✅ State machine workflow (7 states)
- ✅ Async processing model
- ✅ Real-time progress (SSE + polling)
- ✅ Error handling strategy
- ✅ Performance targets
- ✅ Security validation
- ✅ Testing strategy

**Implementation Coverage:**
- ✅ HTTP API spec (IMPL008)
- ✅ Amplitude analyzer implementation (IMPL009)
- ✅ Parameter management (IMPL010)
- ⚠️ Missing: Detailed implementation specs for remaining 6 modules
