## Key Findings from Investigation

### Active Mixer Determination

**Legacy Mixer is Active:**
- Location: `wkmp-ap/src/playback/engine.rs:238`
- Import: `use crate::playback::pipeline::mixer::CrossfadeMixer;`
- Instantiation: `let mut mixer = CrossfadeMixer::new();`
- **Violation:** Applies fade curves at mix time (violates SPEC016 [DBD-MIX-042])

**Correct Mixer is Inactive:**
- Location: `wkmp-ap/src/playback/mixer.rs` (359 lines)
- Status: Exists but not instantiated anywhere
- **Compliance:** Reads pre-faded samples (compliant with SPEC016 [DBD-MIX-042])
- **Gap:** Missing features (underrun detection, position events, resume fade-in)

### Migration Decision

**Option A Selected:** Port features from legacy to correct mixer

**Rationale:**
- Achieves SPEC016 compliance (primary goal)
- Simpler architecture (359 vs 1,969 lines)
- Lower residual risk
- Test-driven migration with 23 tests

**Implications:**
- ✅ REQ-MIX-007 (underrun detection) required
- ✅ REQ-MIX-008 (position events) required
- ✅ REQ-MIX-009 (resume fade-in) required
- ⏭️ Cannot delete legacy mixer until migration complete
- ⏭️ Increments 3-8 required for full migration

## Specification Changes Detail

### SPEC002 v1.2 Changes

**[XFD-CURV-050] Application Timing (line 215):**
```
Fade curves are applied to audio samples by the Fader component BEFORE buffering.
The mixer reads pre-faded samples and performs simple addition during crossfade overlap.
See [SPEC016 DBD-MIX-042] for architectural separation details.
```

**Purpose:** Clarifies WHEN fade curves are applied (before buffering, not at mix time)

**[XFD-IMPL-025] Architectural Note (line 336):**
```
This algorithm calculates crossfade TIMING (when passages overlap). Fade curve
APPLICATION is handled separately by the Fader component per [DBD-MIX-042].
The mixer implements simple addition of pre-faded samples per [DBD-MIX-041].
```

**Purpose:** Clarifies algorithm calculates TIMING (when), not APPLICATION (how)

### SPEC016 v1.4 Changes

**[DBD-MIX-040] Terminology Clarification (line 608):**

**Before:**
```
- When "fading in after pause" also multiplies the sample values by the current fade in curve value
```

**After:**
```
- When "fading in after pause" also multiplies the mixed output by the resume fade-in curve
  (mixer-level fade, orthogonal to passage-level fades applied by Fader component)
```

**Purpose:** Distinguishes mixer-level fade (resume from pause) from passage-level fades (applied by Fader)

**Clarification:** Resume fade IS applied by mixer, but it's orthogonal to passage fades (different layers)

---

## ADR-001 Summary

**Decision:** Migrate from legacy mixer to correct mixer (Option A)

**Context:**
- Two mixers exist: Legacy (1,969 lines, violates SPEC016) vs. Correct (359 lines, compliant)
- Legacy is active, correct is unused
- Root cause: Architectural separation added after legacy implementation

**Migration Strategy (8 Phases):**
1. **Preparation:** Investigation, specification updates, ADR (✅ Complete - Increments 1-2)
2. **Feature Porting:** Port 3 features to correct mixer (⏭️ Increment 3)
3. **Migration:** Update PlaybackEngine to use correct mixer (⏭️ Increment 4)
4. **Testing:** 23 tests verify compliance (⏭️ Increments 5-7)
5. **Cleanup:** Remove legacy mixer (⏭️ Increment 8)

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** SPEC016 compliance, 69-87% code reduction, clearer architecture
- **Negative:** 13-20 hour effort, migration risk (mitigated by tests)

---

## Deviations from Plan

**None.** All planned deliverables for Increments 1-2 completed as specified.

**Note:** ADR was completed in Increment 1 (not split across Increments 1-2 as originally planned). Investigation findings allowed immediate Decision section completion.

## Traceability Matrix Update

| Requirement | Tests | Implementation | Status | Coverage |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|----------|
| REQ-MIX-001 | TC-INV-001-01, TC-INV-001-02 | investigation_report.md | ✅ Complete | Complete |
| REQ-MIX-003 | TC-DOC-003-01 | SPEC002:215 | ✅ Complete | Complete |
| REQ-MIX-004 | TC-DOC-004-01 | SPEC002:336 | ✅ Complete | Complete |

| REQ-MIX-006 | TC-DOC-006-01 | ADR-001-mixer_refactoring.md | ✅ Complete | Complete |

**Increments 1-2:** 5/12 requirements complete (42%)

## Next Steps: Increment 3 (Feature Porting)

**Objective:** Port missing features from legacy to correct mixer while maintaining architectural separation

**Requirements:**
- REQ-MIX-007: Port buffer underrun detection (legacy lines 422-611)
- REQ-MIX-008: Port position event emission (legacy lines 614-642)
- REQ-MIX-009: Port resume fade-in support (legacy lines 644-671)

**Tests:**
- TC-F-007-01: Underrun detection functional
- TC-F-008-01: Position event emission functional
- TC-F-009-01: Resume fade-in functional

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 hours (implementation + testing)

**Constraints:**
- ✅ Must maintain architectural separation (no fade curve knowledge in mixer)
- ✅ Must NOT apply passage-level fade curves
- ✅ Resume fade-in must be multiplicative (applied AFTER mixing)

**Preparation Required:**
1. Read legacy mixer lines 422-611 (underrun detection implementation)
2. Read legacy mixer lines 614-642 (position event implementation)
3. Read legacy mixer lines 644-671 (resume fade-in implementation)
4. Extract behaviors into detailed specifications (resolve MEDIUM-002, MEDIUM-003 issues)
5. Define specific test cases before implementation

---

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

**From PLAN014 Specification Issues:**

**MEDIUM-002 (Resolved):** ADR content depends on investigation - ✅ Resolved (investigation complete, ADR filled)

**MEDIUM-003 (Pending):** Resume fade-in behavior not extracted
- **Status:** Specification exists in legacy mixer lines 644-671
- **Action Required:** Extract implementation details before Increment 3
- **Impact:** Blocks REQ-MIX-009 implementation

**HIGH-002 (Pending):** Underrun detection behavior not extracted
- **Status:** Specification exists in legacy mixer lines 422-611
- **Action Required:** Extract implementation details before Increment 3
- **Impact:** Blocks REQ-MIX-007 implementation

**Recommendation:** Extract feature specifications from legacy mixer before starting Increment 3 implementation.
