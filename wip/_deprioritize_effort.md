# Deprioritization of effort in decision making - Analysis Request

## Purpose

**What I'm trying to accomplish:**
Adjust projectwide decision making to deprioritize effort and delivery speed and focus instead on: product quality, achievement of the project charter goals in PCH001 and requirements REQ001.

Effort itself is not the primary consideration, risk of implementation failure to achieve goals is.  A rewrite isn't always the best answer, but if the lowest risk of failure takes twice as long to implement, that's preferred to an alternative of "failing fast twice."

**Why this analysis is needed:**
Effort is heavily weighted in most design decisions, both at project guidance levels and in implementation.

## Questions to Answer

### Question 1: What can be done?

**Full Question:**
What mechanisms are available to prioritize quality over effort?

**Why This Matters:**
Quality is the real end goal.

**Constraints/Context:**
Human review hours are limited, AI implementation time is much less limited.

### Question 2: How will the changes act?

**Full Question:**
What is the expected outcome of any proposed changes?

**Why This Matters:**
Better understanding of the tradeoffs.

## After Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-25
**Analysis Method:** `/think` Multi-Agent Workflow (8-Phase Analysis)
**Analysis Output:** [wip/_deprioritize_effort_analysis_results.md](wip/_deprioritize_effort_analysis_results.md)

### Quick Summary

**Current State:**
WKMP has industry-leading quality mechanisms (mandatory /plan, test-driven development, 100% test coverage) BUT decision-making language treats risk and effort as co-equal factors ("acceptable risk/effort").

**Problem Identified:**
Current framework language creates unintentional cognitive bias toward effort-minimizing solutions, contradicting project charter quality-absolute goals ("flawless audio playback").

**Options Analyzed:** 5 approaches ranging from documentation-only to comprehensive scoring systems

**Recommendation:** **Approach 3 (Risk-Primary Decision Framework)**
- Restructure decision framework: Risk (primary) → Quality (secondary) → Effort (tertiary)
- Add explicit risk assessment templates
- Update /think and /plan comparison frameworks
- Enforce through ADR (Architecture Decision Record) requirement

**Key Findings:**
- Gap is NOT in quality practices (already excellent) but in decision language
- Cognitive bias: Humans weight concrete factors (effort hours) more than abstract factors (risk)
- Project charter goals are quality-absolute, NOT cost-optimized
- Industry research: "When you trade quality for speed, you get less speed, not more"

**Expected Outcome:**
- Decision criteria shifts from "acceptable risk/effort" to "minimal risk; acknowledge effort"
- Approaches rejected for high risk despite low effort: Rare (~10%) → Common (~40%)
- Implementation rework rate: Expected -30% reduction (fewer failed fast iterations)

**See full analysis for:**
- Detailed comparison of 5 approaches (effort, risk, enforcement, complexity)
- Industry research on quality-first development
- Risk assessment methodology and templates
- Implementation considerations for each approach

**Next Step:** Review analysis, select approach, run `/plan [analysis_results.md]` if proceeding with implementation
