## HIGH Priority Issues (3 total)

### HIGH-001: Pagination State Management Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-020 (Paginated Table Browsing)
**Category:** Missing Specification
**Issue:** Pagination state persistence not specified - does page position persist across table switches or reset?

**Impact:** UX inconsistency - user may lose context when switching between tables

**Current Specification:**
- "Table views SHALL display maximum 100 rows per page with pagination controls"
- Does not specify: Do we remember page 5 of `passages` when user views `files` then returns?

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Option A:** Reset to page 1 on every table switch (simpler, predictable)
- **Option B:** Remember last page per table (better UX, more complex)
- **Recommendation:** Option A for MVP, Option B for future enhancement

**Testability:** Can test once decision made
**Workaround:** Implement Option A (reset), document as known limitation

---

### HIGH-002: Sort State Persistence Unclear

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-080 (Sort Columns), REQ-DR-F-100 (User Preference Persistence)
**Category:** Ambiguity
**Issue:** Should column sort preference persist across sessions via localStorage?

**Current Specification:**
- REQ-DR-F-080: "User SHALL be able to sort any table column"
- REQ-DR-F-100: "User preferences... SHALL persist across application restarts"
- Does not specify: Is sort direction a "preference" or transient state?

**Implications:**
- If persisted: User returns to last sort order (better for power users)
- If not persisted: Always default sort (simpler, more predictable)

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Decision:** Do NOT persist sort state for MVP
- **Rationale:** Sort is query-specific context, not global preference
- **Future:** Add "Remember my preferences" checkbox if users request

**Testability:** Testable once decision made
**Workaround:** Implement default sort only, document behavior

---

### HIGH-003: Error Message Content Not Specified

**Requirement:** All requirements (error handling implied)
**Category:** Missing Specification
**Issue:** Error message content and format not specified for failure cases

**Examples of Unspecified Errors:**
- Database connection fails (wkmp.db missing or corrupted)
- Search by Work ID finds no results
- Invalid UUID format in search form
- Authentication fails (timestamp expired)

**Current Specification:**
- Requirements focus on happy path behavior
- Error cases mentioned briefly ("handles zero results gracefully")
- Specific error messages not specified

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **Define standard error format:**
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error category (DatabaseError, ValidationError, etc.)",
    "message": "User-friendly message",
    "details": "Technical details (optional, for debugging)"
  }
  ```
- **Error message guidelines:**
  - Be specific (not "Operation failed")
  - Include next steps ("Check database path in settings")
  - Log technical details, show user-friendly summary

**Testability:** Can test error paths once messages defined
**Workaround:** Implement generic error messages, refine based on testing

---

## MEDIUM Priority Issues (5 total)

### MEDIUM-001: Table Column Display Order Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-010 (Table Viewing)
**Category:** Minor Ambiguity
**Issue:** Column display order not specified - alphabetical, schema order, or custom priority?

**Impact:** Low - any order is functional, but inconsistency may confuse

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Display columns in schema definition order (matches database metadata)
- Alternative: Alphabetical for consistency
- **Decision:** Schema order for MVP

**Testability:** Verifiable by inspection
**Workaround:** Implement schema order, easy to change later

---

### MEDIUM-002: Timestamp Display Format Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-010 (Table Viewing)
**Category:** Missing Specification
**Issue:** How to display timestamp columns (Unix epoch, ISO 8601, human-readable)?

**Examples:**
- `created_at`, `updated_at` fields in database
- Currently stored as ISO 8601 strings or Unix timestamps

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Display as: "2025-11-01 14:30:45 UTC" (human-readable)
- Tooltip: Show Unix timestamp or ISO 8601 (for copy-paste)
- **Rationale:** Usability over technical precision

**Testability:** Visual inspection
**Workaround:** Implement human-readable format

---

### MEDIUM-003: Large Text Field Truncation Strategy Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-010 (Table Viewing)
**Category:** Missing Specification
**Issue:** How to display long text fields (e.g., `musical_flavor` JSON, 500+ chars)?

**Problem:** Large JSON or text fields make table unreadable

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Truncate to 100 characters with "..." indicator
- Click to expand full content (modal or expandable row)
- **Alternative:** Horizontal scroll within cell

**Testability:** Test with large text fields
**Workaround:** Implement truncation with expand-on-click

---

### MEDIUM-004: UUID Display Format Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-010 (Table Viewing)
**Category:** Minor Issue
**Issue:** UUID display format - full (36 chars) or shortened (first 8 chars)?

**Examples:**
- Full: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- Short: `550e8400...` (truncated with tooltip for full)

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Display full UUID for copy-paste functionality
- Monospace font for readability
- **Alternative:** Truncate with tooltip (saves space)

**Testability:** Visual inspection
**Workaround:** Display full UUID

---

### MEDIUM-005: Page Size Configurability Unspecified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-F-020 (Pagination)
**Category:** Missing Feature
**Issue:** Page size fixed at 100 rows - should user be able to change (25, 50, 100, 200)?

**Current Specification:** "Maximum 100 rows per page" - implies fixed

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **MVP:** Fixed 100 rows (simpler)
- **Future:** Dropdown to select page size (stored in localStorage per REQ-DR-F-100)

**Testability:** Test with 100 rows only for MVP
**Workaround:** Document fixed page size, add configurability later

---

## LOW Priority Issues (4 total)

### LOW-001: Browser Compatibility Not Fully Specified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-UI-020 (Vanilla JavaScript)
**Category:** Documentation Gap
**Issue:** Minimum browser versions not explicitly listed

**Assumptions Made:**
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+ (per scope_statement.md assumptions)
- ES6 features required: Arrow functions, template literals, fetch API, localStorage

**Recommended Resolution:**
- Document minimum browser requirements in README
- Test on target browsers before release

**Testability:** Manual testing on target browsers
**Workaround:** Assume modern browsers, document requirements

---

### LOW-002: Keyboard Navigation Not Fully Specified

**Requirement:** REQ-DR-UI-050 (Table Rendering)
**Category:** Incomplete Specification
**Issue:** Keyboard navigation mentioned ("Tab, Enter") but not fully detailed

**Missing Details:**
- Arrow keys for row navigation?
- Spacebar for selection?
- Escape to close modal dialogs?

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **MVP:** Basic Tab/Enter navigation only
- **Future:** Full keyboard shortcuts (document in help page)

**Testability:** Manual keyboard testing
**Workaround:** Implement basic navigation, iterate based on feedback

---

### LOW-003: Data Export Not Specified (But Useful)

**Requirement:** None (explicitly out of scope)
**Category:** Feature Gap
**Issue:** No way to export filtered results (CSV, JSON) for external analysis

**Impact:** Users may want to export "passages lacking MBID" list for bulk processing

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **MVP:** Out of scope (per scope_statement.md)
- **Future Release:** Add export buttons (CSV, JSON download)
- Track as future enhancement

**Testability:** N/A for MVP
**Workaround:** User can copy-paste from table (not ideal, but functional)

---

### LOW-004: Real-Time Updates Not Specified

**Requirement:** None (explicitly out of scope)
**Category:** Feature Gap
**Issue:** Table view is snapshot - does not update if wkmp-ai imports new files

**Impact:** User must refresh page to see new data

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **MVP:** Manual refresh (button or F5)
- **Future:** SSE integration for live updates (similar to wkmp-ai import progress)
- Track as future enhancement

**Testability:** N/A for MVP
**Workaround:** Document "Refresh to see latest data"

---

## Consistency Check Results

### Consistency Issue Found (MEDIUM)

**CONS-001: Port Assignment Consistency**
**Requirements:** REQ-DR-NF-050 (Port 5725) vs. wkmp-ui integration
**Issue:** wkmp-ui hard-codes port 5725 in launch button URL - if port becomes configurable, wkmp-ui won't know

**Current State:**
- REQ-DR-NF-050: "Module SHALL bind to port 5725" (fixed)
- wkmp-ui button: `http://localhost:5725` (hard-coded)

**Inconsistency:** If port later made configurable via TOML, integration breaks

**Resolution:**
- **MVP:** Keep port 5725 fixed (no configuration)
- **Document:** Port 5725 is non-negotiable for wkmp-ui integration
- **Future:** If port configurability needed, implement service discovery (wkmp-ui queries settings table)

**Risk:** Low (port 5725 unlikely to conflict)

---

## Testability Check Results

**✅ All 24 requirements testable with acceptance criteria defined**

**Test Type Distribution:**
- Unit tests: 12 requirements (database queries, utilities)
- Integration tests: 8 requirements (HTTP endpoints, authentication)
- Manual tests: 4 requirements (UI rendering, browser compatibility)

**Gaps:** None - all requirements have clear pass/fail criteria

---

## Dependency Validation Results

**✅ All dependencies verified and available**

**Checked:**
- wkmp-common utilities: ✅ Exist and stable
- Database schema: ✅ Documented and stable
- External libraries: ✅ All available on crates.io
- wkmp-ui integration point: ✅ Feasible, low risk
- Port 5725: ⚠️ Assumed available (check on deployment)

**Risks:** All low to very low (see dependencies_map.md)

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation

1. **Resolve HIGH-001:** Decide pagination state strategy (recommend: reset to page 1)
2. **Resolve HIGH-002:** Decide sort persistence (recommend: do not persist)
3. **Resolve HIGH-003:** Define error message format and content

### During Implementation

1. **MEDIUM issues:** Implement recommended resolutions (schema order, truncation, etc.)
2. **Document decisions:** Add to implementation notes for future reference
3. **Track LOW issues:** Create GitHub issues for future enhancements (export, keyboard shortcuts)

### After Implementation

1. **Validate assumptions:** Test on target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Usability testing:** Verify error messages are clear and actionable
3. **Performance testing:** Verify pagination handles 100k+ row tables
