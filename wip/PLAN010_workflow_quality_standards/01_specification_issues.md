## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Example Format Not Specified (MEDIUM)

**Requirement:** REQ-WQ-004 (Plan Execution and Completion Standards)
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Type:** Specification Gap

**Issue:**
Analysis specifies "Examples and templates" must be included but doesn't specify:
- How many examples?
- What format for templates?
- Real examples or hypothetical?

**Impact:**
- Implementation may provide too few examples (not actionable)
- Templates may not be detailed enough
- Users may not understand how to apply standards

**Recommendation:**
- Provide 2-3 concrete examples for each standard
- Templates should be copy-paste ready with [placeholders]
- Use hypothetical examples (not actual WKMP code)

**Resolution Status:** Clarified in recommendations above

---

### Issue #2: "Clear Examples" Subjective (MEDIUM)

**Requirement:** REQ-WQ-008 (Shortcut vs. Phased Delivery Distinction)
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Type:** Ambiguity

**Issue:**
Requirement states "clear examples" but doesn't quantify:
- How many examples are sufficient?
- What makes an example "clear"?
- Should examples be from WKMP or generic?

**Impact:**
- Implementation may provide insufficient examples
- Users may still be unclear about distinction

**Recommendation:**
- Provide 2-3 examples of acceptable phased delivery
- Provide 2-3 examples of unacceptable shortcuts
- Use generic software examples (not WKMP-specific to avoid confusion)
- Each example should be 3-5 sentences with clear rationale

**Resolution Status:** Clarified in recommendations above

---

### Issue #3: Phase 8 Location Ambiguous (LOW)

**Requirement:** REQ-WQ-012 (Update Phase 8 Plan Template)
**Severity:** 🔵 LOW
**Type:** Minor Ambiguity

**Issue:**
"Update Phase 8" doesn't specify WHERE in Phase 8 section to add content.

**Impact:**
- Minor - implementer must decide placement
- Low impact because Phase 8 structure is clear from reading plan.md

**Recommendation:**
- Add to final report template subsection (likely near end of Phase 8)
- Cross-reference Phase 9 for full technical debt discovery process

**Resolution Status:** Implementation guidance provided
