# Test Specification: TC-M-001-01

**Test ID:** TC-M-001-01
**Test Type:** Manual Verification
**Requirement:** REQ-WQ-001 (Add Professional Objectivity Section to CLAUDE.md)
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Estimated Effort:** 5 minutes

---

## Test Objective

Verify that the "Professional Objectivity" section has been added to CLAUDE.md at the correct location with proper formatting.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] CLAUDE.md changes have been committed
- [ ] Working copy of repository is up to date
- [ ] Text editor or viewer available

---

## Test Scope

**Component Under Test:** CLAUDE.md documentation
**Specific Location:** After line 127 (after "Equivalent Risk Definition" section)
**What We're Verifying:**
- Section exists
- Section is properly positioned
- Section has correct title
- Section follows project formatting standards

---

## Test Procedure

### Given: CLAUDE.md with Professional Objectivity section added

**Initial State:**
- Open CLAUDE.md in text editor
- Locate line 127 (end of "Equivalent Risk Definition" section)

### When: Reviewing document structure

**Actions:**
1. Navigate to line 127 in CLAUDE.md
2. Look for "## Equivalent Risk Definition" section
3. Scroll down to find next major section header

### Then: Professional Objectivity section is present

**Expected Results:**
1. ✅ Section header "# Professional Objectivity" appears after line 127
2. ✅ Section header uses single # (H1 level - consistent with other major sections)
3. ✅ Section appears before any other new content
4. ✅ Proper spacing (blank line before and after section header)

---

## Pass Criteria

**PASS if ALL of the following are true:**
1. ✅ "Professional Objectivity" section exists
2. ✅ Section is located after line 127 (after Equivalent Risk Definition)
3. ✅ Section title exactly matches: "# Professional Objectivity"
4. ✅ Section follows immediately after "## Equivalent Risk Definition" (with appropriate spacing)
5. ✅ Section does NOT modify any existing CLAUDE.md content (additive only)

**Measurement Method:**
- Visual inspection of CLAUDE.md
- Line number verification
- Git diff review to confirm no existing content modified

---

## Fail Criteria

**FAIL if ANY of the following are true:**
- ❌ Section does not exist
- ❌ Section is in wrong location (not after line 127)
- ❌ Section title has wrong formatting (e.g., ## instead of #)
- ❌ Section modifies existing content
- ❌ Section breaks existing document structure

---

## Test Data

**Input:** N/A (verification only)
**Expected Output:** Section present at correct location

**Example of Expected Section Header:**
```markdown
## Equivalent Risk Definition

Approaches have **equivalent risk** when their residual risk (after mitigation) falls in the same category:

- **Low = Low** (equivalent)
...

# Professional Objectivity

**Core Principle:** Technical accuracy and truthfulness take priority over validating user beliefs or preferences.
```

---

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Line 127 vicinity located
- [ ] "Equivalent Risk Definition" section confirmed
- [ ] "Professional Objectivity" section found after it
- [ ] Section header format correct (# not ##)
- [ ] Spacing appropriate (blank lines)
- [ ] No existing content modified (git diff check)

---

## Notes

**Integration Point:** This section integrates with existing Risk-First Decision Framework (lines 61-127). Verify no conflict with that framework.

**Cross-Reference:** REQ-WQ-001 specifies "after line 127" - exact line number may shift if prior content changes, but should be "after Equivalent Risk Definition section" semantically.
