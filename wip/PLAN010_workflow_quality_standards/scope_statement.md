**Plan:** PLAN010
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Source:** wip/_attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md (Approach 2)

---

## In Scope

### 1. Professional Objectivity Standard (CLAUDE.md)
✅ **Add new section after line 127:** "Professional Objectivity"
✅ **Content (~75 lines):**
- Core principle statement (technical correctness > user validation)
- Fact vs. opinion standards with examples
- Respectful disagreement protocol
- Bias awareness guidance
- Evidence citation standards
- 2-3 concrete examples of appropriate behavior

✅ **Integration:**
- Cross-reference existing Risk-First Framework (lines 61-127)
- Position after Equivalent Risk Definition section

### 2. Plan Execution and Completion Standards (plan.md)
✅ **Add new section after line 727:** "Plan Execution and Completion Standards"
✅ **Content (~250 lines):**
- Mandatory execution requirements:
  - All increments must be completed OR explicitly approved for skipping
  - No-shortcut implementation definition and enforcement
  - "Plan complete" claim requirements
- Completion report standard:
  - Planned vs. Actual comparison table
  - Scope changes documentation
  - "What Was NOT Done" explicit section
- Examples and templates for completion reports
- Enforcement mechanisms

✅ **Integration:**
- Reference existing completion checklist (lines 697-709)
- Build on existing workflow execution verification

### 3. Post-Implementation Review Process (plan.md)
✅ **Add new section after Phase 8:** "Phase 9: Post-Implementation Review and Technical Debt Assessment"
✅ **Content (~300 lines):**
- Technical debt definition (8 categories)
- Technical debt discovery process (7-step mandatory checklist):
  1. Code review (TODOs, FIXMEs, warnings)
  2. Test coverage review
  3. Quality review (duplication, complexity)
  4. Known problems catalog
  5. Error handling completeness
  6. Performance bottlenecks
  7. Security concerns
- Technical debt reporting standard (mandatory final report section)
- Templates and examples
- Guidance on categorization (High/Medium/Low priority)

✅ **Integration:**
- Integrate with Phase 8 plan documentation
- Reference existing workflow execution verification checklist

### 4. Phase 8 Plan Documentation Updates (plan.md)
✅ **Update existing Phase 8 section** (~50 lines of additions)
✅ **Add to plan final report template:**
- Mandatory "Technical Debt and Known Problems" section
- Template structure with High/Medium/Low categorization
- Link to Phase 9 discovery process

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included:

❌ **Complete rewrite of CLAUDE.md or plan.md** (Approach 1 - rejected due to high risk)
❌ **Lightweight checklist only** (Approach 3 - rejected as inadequate)
❌ **Modification of existing standards content** (only additions allowed)
❌ **Implementation of enforcement tooling** (standards are documentation-based)
❌ **Retroactive application to completed plans** (applies to future work only)
❌ **Changes to /think workflow** (focus is on plan execution and decision-making)
❌ **Changes to /commit or /archive workflows** (not relevant to quality values)
❌ **Changes to other workflow commands** (scope limited to CLAUDE.md and plan.md)
❌ **User training materials** (documentation is self-explanatory)
❌ **Examples from actual WKMP code** (use generic examples)

---

## Assumptions

1. **Current Standards Are Sound:**
   - Risk-First Decision Framework (CLAUDE.md) is effective
   - Plan workflow structure (plan.md) is fundamentally correct
   - Additive changes will not conflict with existing content

2. **User Adoption:**
   - Users will read and apply new standards
   - Standards enforcement through documentation and review is sufficient
   - No automated enforcement tooling is required initially

3. **Documentation Format:**
   - Markdown format is appropriate for standards documentation
   - Examples and templates can be provided inline
   - Line count targets (75, 250, 300, 50) are achievable

4. **Integration:**
   - New sections can be cleanly inserted at specified locations
   - Cross-references to existing content will be clear
   - No restructuring of existing sections is needed

5. **Scope Completeness:**
   - Four core values (anti-sycophancy, anti-laziness, anti-hurry, problem transparency) are fully addressed by three new sections
   - No additional standards are needed at this time

---

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **File Locations:**
   - CLAUDE.md is in project root
   - plan.md is in .claude/commands/
   - Both are tracked in git

2. **Size Limits:**
   - Follow CLAUDE.md verbosity standards (20-40% reduction from comprehensive)
   - Each section must be concise but complete
   - Total additions: ~675 lines across both files

3. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Existing workflows must continue to function
   - No breaking changes to document structure
   - All existing line number references in other documents remain valid

### Process Constraints
1. **Review and Approval:**
   - User must review and approve plan before implementation
   - User must review and approve each document change before commit

2. **Testing:**
   - No automated tests for documentation
   - Verification through manual review and reading
   - Cross-reference validation manual

3. **Timeline:**
   - Estimated effort: 15-25 hours (per analysis recommendation)
   - Expected timeline: 2-3 weeks (per analysis recommendation)
   - No hard deadline, prioritize quality over speed

### Content Constraints
1. **Tone and Style:**
   - Professional, directive (use MUST/SHALL for requirements)
   - Clear, unambiguous language
   - Examples for complex concepts
   - Consistent with existing WKMP documentation style

2. **Integration:**
   - Must reference existing related standards
   - Must not contradict existing standards
   - Must be logically positioned in document flow

3. **Completeness:**
   - Each standard must be actionable (clear what to do)
   - Each standard must be verifiable (clear when compliant)
   - Examples must be concrete and realistic

## Risk Mitigation Built Into Scope

### Risk: Conflict with Existing Standards
**Mitigation:** Only additive changes; extensive cross-referencing to show integration

### Risk: Standards Too Vague
**Mitigation:** Include concrete examples and templates for each standard

### Risk: Standards Too Prescriptive
**Mitigation:** Focus on principles and objectives, provide guidance not rigid rules

### Risk: User Resistance
**Mitigation:** Standards address real pain points identified in original request; clearly beneficial

### Risk: Incomplete Coverage
**Mitigation:** Four values explicitly addressed; traceability matrix ensures 100% coverage

---

## Scope Validation

**Questions to Verify Scope:**

1. ✅ Does scope address all four core values?
   - Anti-sycophancy → REQ-WQ-001, 002, 003
   - Anti-laziness → REQ-WQ-004, 005, 006, 007
   - Anti-hurry → REQ-WQ-008 (integrated with REQ-WQ-004)
   - Problem transparency → REQ-WQ-009, 010, 011, 012

2. ✅ Is scope aligned with Approach 2 recommendation?
   - Yes: Targeted enhancement, not rewrite (not Approach 1)
   - Yes: Comprehensive standards, not lightweight checklist (not Approach 3)

3. ✅ Are deliverables clearly defined?
   - CLAUDE.md additions specified by line count and content
   - plan.md additions specified by line count and content
   - Templates and examples included

4. ✅ Are boundaries clear?
   - In-scope items explicitly listed
   - Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
   - No ambiguity about what will/won't be done

5. ✅ Are dependencies identified?
   - Existing documents listed
   - Integration points specified
   - No hidden dependencies

Three new standards sections (~675 lines total) to institute four core workflow quality values in existing documentation.

**What We're NOT Building:**
New tools, complete document rewrites, or changes to working code.

**Why This Scope:**
Lowest-risk approach to address critical gaps (especially technical debt reporting) while preserving effective existing standards.

**How We'll Know We're Done:**
All 12 requirements implemented, all cross-references accurate, all examples clear, user approves final review.
