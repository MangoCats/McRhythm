# PLAN010: Workflow Quality Standards Enhancement - PLAN SUMMARY

**Status:** Ready for Implementation (Phases 1-3 Complete)
**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Specification Source:** wip/_attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md (Approach 2 - Targeted Standards Enhancement)
**Plan Location:** `wip/PLAN010_workflow_quality_standards/`

---

## READ THIS FIRST

**This document (~400 lines) provides complete overview of PLAN010.**

**For Implementation:**
- Read this summary
- Review detailed requirements: `requirements_index.md`
- Review test specifications: `02_test_specifications/test_index.md`
- Follow traceability matrix: `02_test_specifications/traceability_matrix.md`

**Context Window Budget:** Summary (~400 lines) + Requirements (~200 lines) + Tests (~150 lines) = ~750 lines total

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Being Solved

Four critical workflow quality gaps identified in current WKMP development standards:

1. **Anti-Sycophancy Gap:** No explicit "Professional Objectivity" standard - risk of biasing recommendations toward user preferences
2. **Anti-Laziness Gap:** No enforcement for plan completion - risk of marking incomplete work as "PLAN COMPLETE"
3. **Anti-Hurry Gap:** No explicit "no shortcuts" standard - risk of partial implementations
4. **Problem Transparency Gap (CRITICAL):** ZERO technical debt reporting standards - risk of silent quality degradation

**Most Critical:** Technical debt reporting completely absent from current standards.

---

### Solution Approach: Targeted Standards Enhancement (Approach 2)

**NOT doing:** Complete rewrite (Approach 1 - high risk, 80-120 hours)
**NOT doing:** Lightweight checklist (Approach 3 - inadequate for technical debt)
**DOING:** Additive standards sections (~675 lines across 2 documents, 15-25 hours)

**Four New Standards Sections:**

1. **CLAUDE.md Addition (~75 lines):**
   - New section: "Professional Objectivity" (after line 127)
   - Addresses Value 1: Anti-Sycophancy
   - Core principle, standards, examples

2. **plan.md Addition 1 (~250 lines):**
   - New section: "Plan Execution and Completion Standards" (after line 727)
   - Addresses Value 2: Anti-Laziness + Value 3: Anti-Hurry
   - Mandatory execution requirements, completion report standard, no-shortcut definition

3. **plan.md Addition 2 (~300 lines):**
   - New section: "Phase 9: Post-Implementation Review and Technical Debt Assessment"
   - Addresses Value 4: Problem Transparency (CRITICAL GAP)
   - 7-step technical debt discovery process, reporting standard, templates

4. **plan.md Update (~50 lines):**
   - Update Phase 8 final report template
   - Add mandatory technical debt section reference

**Total:** ~675 lines of new standards, zero modifications to existing content

---

## Technical Debt Discovery Process (REQ-WQ-010)

**7-Step Mandatory Checklist (to be documented in Phase 9):**

1. **Code Review:**
   - Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX comments
   - Review all compiler warnings
   - Check error handling paths
   - Identify workarounds

2. **Test Coverage Review:**
   - Measure test coverage
   - Identify untested edge cases
   - List skipped tests
   - Note flaky tests

3. **Quality Review:**
   - Check for code duplication
   - Identify overly complex functions
   - Note unclear/undocumented behavior
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

4. **Known Problems Catalog:**
   - List ALL known bugs
   - List ALL edge cases not handled
   - List ALL assumptions that may not hold
   - List ALL limitations

5. **Error Handling Completeness:**
   - Verify all error paths covered
   - Check for ignored errors
   - Validate error messages clear

6. **Performance Assessment:**
   - Identify observed bottlenecks
   - Note deferred optimizations
   - Document performance constraints

7. **Security Review:**
   - Note any security concerns
   - Document assumptions about trust boundaries
   - List areas needing security review

**Output:** Mandatory technical debt report section in final plan execution report

## Risk Assessment (from Analysis)

### Approach 2 Risk Profile

**Residual Risk:** Low (after mitigation)

**Failure Modes:**
1. **New sections conflict with existing standards** - Probability: Low - Impact: Low
   - Mitigation: Careful integration, explicit cross-references
2. **Users miss new requirements** - Probability: Low - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Update README, changelog, clear section headers
3. **Standards interpreted inconsistently** - Probability: Low - Impact: Low
   - Mitigation: Provide concrete examples and templates

**Why Approach 2 (vs. Approach 1 or 3):**
- Lowest residual risk among effective approaches
- Addresses all four gaps comprehensively (including critical technical debt gap)
- Minimal disruption to working patterns
- Technical debt gap REQUIRES proper process (checklist insufficient)

**Full Risk Analysis:** See wip/_attitude_adjustment_analysis_results.md lines 500-600

## Document Navigation

**Start Here:** This file (00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md)

**Detailed Planning:**
- `requirements_index.md` - All 12 requirements with priorities
- `scope_statement.md` - In/out scope, assumptions, constraints
- `01_specification_issues.md` - Phase 2 analysis (0 critical, 2 medium, 1 low)

**Test Specifications:**
- `02_test_specifications/test_index.md` - All 16 tests quick reference
- `02_test_specifications/tc_m_001_01.md` - Example detailed test spec
- `02_test_specifications/traceability_matrix.md` - Requirements ↔ Tests mapping

**For Implementation:**
- Read this summary (~400 lines)
- Read current increment specification (from roadmap above)
- Read relevant test specs (~100 lines each)
- **Total context:** ~600-750 lines per increment

**DO NOT read:** Full plan consolidation (not yet created - will be ~1500 lines for archival only)

---

## Context Window Management

**Optimal Implementation Pattern:**
1. Read 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md (this file, ~400 lines) - overview
2. Read specific increment details (~150 lines) - current work
3. Read relevant test specs (~100-150 lines) - acceptance criteria
4. **Total:** ~650-700 lines in context
5. Implement to pass tests
6. Move to next increment

**DO NOT load:**
- Full requirements document at once (use requirements_index instead)
- All test specs at once (read only current increment's tests)
- Full plan consolidation (for archival/review only, not implementation)

**Result:** Efficient context usage, focused implementation, no information overload
