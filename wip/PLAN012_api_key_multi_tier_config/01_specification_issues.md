## Completeness Analysis

### Requirements Coverage

**Functional Requirements:** COMPLETE
- Multi-tier resolution (Database → ENV → TOML) - Fully specified
- Write-back behavior - All scenarios covered
- Validation - Basic validation specified
- Error handling - All error cases addressed
- Generic settings sync - Interface defined

**Non-Functional Requirements:** COMPLETE
- Security (file permissions, warnings) - Fully specified
- Performance (best-effort TOML write) - Graceful degradation specified
- Logging and observability - All log messages specified
- Testing - Unit/integration/manual test requirements defined
- Migration - Backward compatibility addressed

**User Interface Requirements:** COMPLETE
- Web UI endpoint - Request/response format specified
- Settings page - UI elements listed
- Security (no key display) - Specified

### Specification Gaps (NONE CRITICAL)

**No critical gaps identified.** Specification is implementation-ready for core functionality.

**Minor gaps (addressed in issues below):**
- TOML schema includes Serialize (spec shows Deserialize only) - MEDIUM
- Atomic rename behavior on Windows not fully specified - MEDIUM
- Test coverage metrics not quantified - MEDIUM
- Key format validation details deferred to AcoustID client - LOW (acceptable)
- Bulk settings sync details deferred to future - LOW (out of scope)

---

## Ambiguity Analysis

### Resolved Ambiguities

**APIK-TOML-SCHEMA-010:** "TomlConfig struct SHALL be extended" - CLEAR
- Shows exact struct definition with all fields
- Serde attributes specified
- No ambiguity on implementation

**APIK-ATOMIC-010:** "Atomic file operations" - CLEAR
- Steps enumerated (1. serialize, 2. temp file, 3. permissions, 4. rename)
- Temp file naming specified (.toml.tmp)
- No ambiguity on implementation

**APIK-WB-040:** "Best-effort approach" - CLEAR
- Success/failure behavior specified
- Log levels specified (info vs warn)
- Never fail operation on TOML write failure - Explicit

### Remaining Ambiguities (MINOR)

**Issue SPEC-AMB-001 (MEDIUM):** TOML field preservation mechanism not specified
- **Requirement:** [APIK-TOML-030] "TOML write SHALL preserve all existing fields"
- **Ambiguity:** How to preserve fields not in TomlConfig struct (e.g., user-added comments, unknown keys)
- **Impact:** May lose user comments or custom fields during write-back
- **Recommendation:** Specify that struct-based serialization will preserve TomlConfig fields only. Comments and unknown fields will be lost. Document as limitation.

**Issue SPEC-AMB-002 (LOW):** "Valid key" definition incomplete for ENV/TOML sources
- **Requirement:** [APIK-RES-030], [APIK-RES-040] reference "valid key"
- **Ambiguity:** Does ENV/TOML validation match database validation? (empty, whitespace, NULL)
- **Impact:** Inconsistent validation across sources could cause confusion
- **Recommendation:** Clarify that ENV/TOML validation matches database validation per [APIK-VAL-010]

---

## Consistency Analysis

### Internal Consistency

**PASS:** Requirements are internally consistent within SPEC025.

**Verified:**
- Priority order consistent (Database → ENV → TOML) across all resolution requirements
- Write-back behavior consistent across ENV and UI sources
- Error handling consistent (database fails operation, TOML warns only)
- Logging messages consistent with resolution and migration behavior

### Cross-Document Consistency

**PASS:** Requirements align with upstream specifications.

**Verified against:**
- REQ-NF-035 (Multi-tier configuration) - SPEC025 extends this pattern correctly
- IMPL001 (Database schema) - Settings table usage matches existing pattern
- IMPL012 (AcoustID client) - No conflicts with existing implementation
- wkmp-common/src/config.rs - TomlConfig extension follows existing pattern

**No conflicts identified.**

---

## Testability Analysis

### Unit Test Coverage

**PASS:** All functional requirements are unit-testable.

**Testable requirements (examples):**
- [APIK-RES-010] through [APIK-RES-050] - Multi-tier resolution (mock db/env/toml)
- [APIK-WB-010] through [APIK-WB-040] - Write-back behavior (verify db and toml writes)
- [APIK-VAL-010] - Validation (test empty, whitespace, NULL)
- [APIK-ATOMIC-010] - Atomic write (verify temp file, rename, permissions)
- [APIK-SEC-010], [APIK-SEC-020] - Permissions (Unix only, verify 0600)

### Integration Test Coverage

**PASS:** End-to-end scenarios are testable.

**Testable scenarios:**
- wkmp-ai startup with key resolution
- Web UI endpoint save key
- Database deletion → TOML restore
- Concurrent module startup (TOML read safety)

### Manual Test Coverage

**PASS:** User-facing scenarios defined.

**Manual test scenarios specified:**
- ENV → Database + TOML migration
- TOML → Database migration
- Web UI save
- Database deletion recovery
- Read-only TOML graceful degradation
- Permission warnings

### Testability Issues

**Issue SPEC-TEST-001 (MEDIUM):** Test coverage metrics not quantified
- **Requirement:** [APIK-TEST-010] lists test cases but no coverage target
- **Issue:** "100% unit test coverage" implied by traceability matrix, but not explicit in requirement
- **Impact:** Ambiguity on acceptable test coverage percentage
- **Recommendation:** Clarify that 100% requirement coverage is target (every requirement → at least one test)

---

## Specification Issues

### CRITICAL Issues (0)

**None identified.** No blockers to implementation.

### HIGH-Priority Issues (0)

**None identified.** All high-risk requirements are well-specified.

### MEDIUM-Priority Issues (3)

**Issue SPEC-IMPL-001:** TOML schema Serialize trait not shown in requirement
- **Requirement:** [APIK-TOML-SCHEMA-010]
- **Issue:** Spec shows only `#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]` but text says "Deserialize"
- **Impact:** Code must derive Serialize for write_toml_config(), but spec text unclear
- **Resolution:** Code example is correct (includes Serialize). Accept code as authoritative.
- **Action:** None required (code example is implementation spec)

**Issue SPEC-AMB-001:** TOML field preservation mechanism not specified (see Ambiguity Analysis)
- **Impact:** User comments and unknown fields will be lost on TOML write
- **Resolution:** Document as acceptable limitation (struct-based serialization)
- **Action:** Add note to implementation docs about field preservation scope

**Issue SPEC-TEST-001:** Test coverage metrics not quantified (see Testability Analysis)
- **Impact:** Ambiguity on acceptable test coverage
- **Resolution:** Adopt 100% requirement coverage target (implied by traceability matrix)
- **Action:** Clarify in test specifications (Phase 3)

### LOW-Priority Issues (5)

**Issue SPEC-SEC-001:** Windows NTFS ACL behavior not verified
- **Requirement:** [APIK-SEC-030]
- **Issue:** Spec assumes default user-only access, but NTFS ACLs vary by configuration
- **Impact:** Windows security may be weaker than expected in some deployments
- **Resolution:** Document as best-effort (no Windows-specific permission enforcement)
- **Action:** Add warning to documentation about Windows security limitations

**Issue SPEC-AMB-002:** "Valid key" definition incomplete for ENV/TOML (see Ambiguity Analysis)
- **Impact:** Minor - validation behavior consistent but not explicitly stated
- **Resolution:** Apply [APIK-VAL-010] validation to all sources
- **Action:** Clarify in implementation

**Issue SPEC-IMPL-002:** Atomic rename behavior on Windows not specified
- **Requirement:** [APIK-ATOMIC-010]
- **Issue:** std::fs::rename may not be atomic on Windows (may fail if target exists)
- **Impact:** Possible TOML corruption in rare race condition
- **Resolution:** Best-effort approach already specified, document limitation
- **Action:** Add note about Windows rename limitations

**Issue SPEC-DEFER-001:** Key format validation deferred to consuming module
- **Requirement:** [APIK-VAL-020]
- **Issue:** AcoustID key format not validated by resolver (deferred to client)
- **Impact:** Invalid keys accepted by resolver, fail at usage time
- **Resolution:** Acceptable - client has format knowledge, resolver is generic
- **Action:** None required (design decision)

**Issue SPEC-FUT-001:** Bulk settings sync details not specified
- **Requirement:** [APIK-FUT-030]
- **Issue:** Future enhancement mentioned but no design details
- **Impact:** None (out of scope for PLAN012)
- **Resolution:** Defer to future plan when needed
- **Action:** None required

## Risk Assessment

### Specification Risks

**LOW RISK:** Specification is implementation-ready with minor clarifications needed.

**Risk factors:**
- **Completeness:** HIGH (all functional requirements specified)
- **Clarity:** HIGH (most requirements unambiguous)
- **Consistency:** HIGH (internal and external consistency verified)
- **Testability:** HIGH (all requirements testable)

**Residual risks:**
- TOML field preservation may lose user comments (DOCUMENTED LIMITATION)
- Windows security weaker than Unix (ACCEPTABLE - best-effort)
- Test coverage metrics implied but not explicit (CLARIFIED IN PHASE 3)

### Implementation Risks

**LOW RISK:** Implementation follows established patterns.

**Risk factors:**
- Database accessor pattern - EXISTING (wkmp-ap/src/db/settings.rs)
- HTTP endpoint pattern - EXISTING (Axum in wkmp-ai)
- TOML serialization - STANDARD (serde + toml crate)
- Atomic file write - STANDARD (std::fs::rename)

**Residual risks:**
- TOML crate round-trip serialization behavior (MITIGATED by testing)
- Windows atomic rename edge cases (MITIGATED by best-effort approach)

---

## Recommendations

### Proceed to Phase 3

**Decision:** PROCEED to Acceptance Test Definition

**Rationale:**
- Zero critical issues
- Zero high-priority issues
- Medium/low issues are clarifications, not blockers
- Specification quality is HIGH (implementation-ready)

### Actions for Implementation

**During Implementation (Phase 4-5):**
1. Document TOML field preservation scope (struct fields only, comments lost)
2. Add Windows security warning to user documentation
3. Clarify validation consistency across sources (database/ENV/TOML)
4. Test TOML round-trip serialization behavior
5. Add notes about Windows atomic rename limitations

**During Testing (Phase 3):**
1. Define 100% requirement coverage target explicitly
2. Create test cases for all 62 requirements
3. Include Windows-specific test scenarios
4. Include TOML field preservation test

### Issues NOT Requiring Action

**Deferred to future (out of scope):**
- SPEC-FUT-001 (Bulk settings sync) - Future enhancement, no current need
- SPEC-DEFER-001 (Key format validation) - Acceptable design decision
