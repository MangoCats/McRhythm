- User-facing features not implemented
- Core functionality requirements pending
- Sample gaps: REQ-CF-010 through REQ-CF-060 (playback, MusicBrainz, AcousticBrainz)

**DEP (Deployment & Configuration): 112 gaps**
- Deployment packaging not implemented
- Configuration management incomplete
- Auto-start mechanisms pending

**XFD (Crossfade Design): 101 gaps**
- Crossfade algorithms specified but not all implemented
- Some fade curves and timing calculations pending

**SRC (Sample Rate Conversion): 52 gaps**
- Tick-based timing system partially implemented
- Some sample rate conversions pending

**DBD (Decoder Buffer Design): 55 gaps**
- Buffer management partially implemented

### Missing Tests (P1) - Code Exists, No Tests

**Count:** 77 requirements

**Examples:**
- ARCH-ERRH-050: Error handling implemented but not tested
- ARCH-VOL-020: Volume control implemented but not tested
- XFD-IMPL-091 through XFD-IMPL-096: Fade curve implementations lack dedicated tests
- DBD-BUF-065, DBD-BUF-070, DBD-BUF-080: Buffer operations implemented but not fully tested

**Risk:** Untested code may have bugs that surface in production

### Missing Implementation (P1) - Tests Exist, No Code

**Count:** 10 requirements

**Examples:**
- Tests written speculatively before implementation
- Placeholder tests for upcoming features
- Test-driven development approach partially applied

**Status:** Tests ready, awaiting implementation

### Orphaned References (P2) - In Code But Not In Specs

**Count:** 69 references

**Top Examples:**
- [ARCH-ERRH-050]: Referenced in code, not found in specifications
- [ARCH-VOL-020]: Volume control referenced, no spec requirement
- [DBD-BUF-065], [DBD-BUF-070], [DBD-BUF-080]: Buffer operations referenced, specs missing
- [ASYNC-LOCK-001]: Locking strategy referenced, no formal requirement
- [ARCH-CFG-020]: Configuration handling referenced, spec gap

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Implementation-discovered requirements** - Found during coding, not yet documented in specs
2. **Typos or renumbering** - Incorrect requirement ID citations
3. **Spec gaps** - Missing requirements that should be documented

**Action Required:** Review each orphaned reference and either:
- Add missing requirement to specifications (if legitimate)
- Correct typo in code reference
- Remove obsolete reference

## Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0 - Critical)

**Priority: High-Level Requirements (REQ-xxx)**

The 294 REQ-xxx requirements represent user-facing features and core functionality. Only 2% are implemented.

**Recommended approach:**
1. **Identify MVP subset** - Which REQ-xxx requirements are essential for minimal viable product?
2. **Implementation plan** - Create PLAN### documents for high-priority REQ groups
3. **Test-first approach** - Write acceptance tests before implementing REQ-xxx features

**Specific gaps to address:**
- REQ-OV-010: Overall system behavior (no implementation found)
- REQ-CF-010 through REQ-CF-060: Core features (play files, track history, MusicBrainz, AcousticBrainz)
- REQ-NF-030 through REQ-NF-036: Non-functional requirements (config, deployment, graceful degradation)

**Priority: Orphaned References**

69 requirement IDs referenced in code don't exist in specifications. This creates traceability breaks.

**Recommended actions:**
1. **Review top 20 orphaned references** (listed in Appendix A)
2. **For each reference:**
   - If legitimate: Add missing requirement to appropriate SPEC document
   - If typo: Correct the requirement ID in code
   - If obsolete: Remove reference from code
3. **Update documentation** to close traceability gaps

### Short-Term Actions (P1 - High Priority)

**Add Missing Tests for Implemented Code**

77 requirements have code implementation but no test coverage. This is technical debt.

**Recommended approach:**
1. **Create test plan** for untested requirements (use `/plan` workflow)
2. **Prioritize by risk:**
   - Error handling (ARCH-ERRH-xxx): HIGH risk if untested
   - Buffer operations (DBD-BUF-xxx): HIGH risk if untested
   - Fade curves (XFD-IMPL-09x): MEDIUM risk (deterministic algorithms)
3. **Add integration tests** for wkmp-ap module workflows
4. **Target:** Achieve >80% test coverage for implemented requirements

**Complete Partial Implementations**

Some categories show 20-50% coverage, indicating partial implementation:
- XFD (Crossfade): 19% - Complete remaining crossfade algorithms
- SRC (Sample Rate): 22% - Complete tick conversion utilities
- DBD (Decoder Buffer): 47% - Complete buffer management pipeline

**Recommended:** Focus on completing partial implementations before starting new features (reduces context switching, achieves working end-to-end flows).

**Document User Identity Requirements**

UID-xxx category has 36 requirements, 0% implementation. User authentication is critical for multi-user deployment.

**Recommended:**
1. **Verify requirements** - Review SPEC010 user identity specification
2. **Plan implementation** - Use `/plan SPEC010` to create implementation plan
3. **Implement in phases:**
   - Phase 1: Anonymous user (UID-ANON-xxx)
   - Phase 2: Registration (UID-CREATE-xxx)
   - Phase 3: Login (UID-AUTH-xxx)
   - Phase 4: Management (UID-MGMT-xxx)

### Long-Term Actions (Continuous Improvement)

**Establish Traceability Discipline**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Mandatory requirement citations** - All new code must cite requirement IDs in comments
2. **Pre-commit validation** - Run `/check-traceability` before every commit
3. **Monthly reviews** - Track traceability metrics over time
4. **Specification-first development** - Write/update specs before implementation

**Target metrics:**
- Code coverage: 80% (currently 9%)
- Test coverage: 70% (currently 4%)
- Full traceability: 60% (currently 3%)
- Orphaned references: <5 (currently 69)

**Implement Remaining Microservices**

Three microservices show 0% implementation:
- wkmp-ui (User Interface): Port 5720
- wkmp-pd (Program Director): Port 5722
- wkmp-ai (Audio Ingest): Port 5723
- wkmp-le (Lyric Editor): Port 5724

**Recommended order:**
1. **wkmp-ui** (CRITICAL): Required for user interaction, API orchestration
2. **wkmp-pd** (HIGH): Required for automatic passage selection
3. **wkmp-ai** (MEDIUM): Full version only, file ingestion
4. **wkmp-le** (LOW): Full version only, lyric editing

**Create Integration Test Suite**

Current tests are primarily unit tests within wkmp-ap. Need end-to-end tests.

**Recommended:**
1. **Multi-service tests** - Test HTTP API interactions between modules
2. **Workflow tests** - Test complete user workflows (enqueue → play → crossfade)
3. **Performance tests** - Test under load (concurrent users, large queues)
4. **Regression tests** - Prevent bugs from reoccurring

## Conclusion

WKMP demonstrates excellent specification discipline with 1,270 well-documented requirements across 13 categories. However, implementation is in early stages with only 9.3% code coverage and 4.0% test coverage.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive specification framework (GOV001 5-tier hierarchy)
- ✅ Consistent requirement ID usage in documentation
- ✅ Strong traceability in implemented code (comments cite requirements)
- ✅ Core infrastructure showing good progress (SSE 83%, ARCH 71%, DBD 47%)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ 90% of requirements not yet implemented (1,142 critical gaps)
- ❌ High-level REQ-xxx requirements only 2% covered (6/294)
- ❌ 69 orphaned references need spec documentation
- ❌ 77 implemented requirements lack test coverage

**Recommended Focus:**
1. Complete partial implementations (XFD, SRC, DBD) to achieve working audio pipeline
2. Add tests for 77 untested implementations (reduce technical debt)
3. Document 69 orphaned references (close traceability gaps)
4. Begin implementing high-priority REQ-xxx requirements for MVP
5. Implement wkmp-ui microservice (critical dependency for user interaction)

**Overall Assessment:** Project is well-architected with strong documentation governance. Implementation is proceeding systematically from infrastructure upward. Recommend maintaining current specification-first discipline while accelerating implementation and test coverage.
