**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Plan:** PLAN005_wkmp_ap_reimplementation
**Purpose:** Document all specification fixes for user review and approval
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL

---

## Executive Summary

During Phase 2 (Specification Completeness Verification), 48 issues were identified across 8 specifications. All **18 CRITICAL** and **21 HIGH** severity issues have been resolved through specification updates with documented implementation decisions.

**Key Actions Taken:**
1. Fixed fundamental architecture error (API time units)
2. Completed missing API response contracts
3. Defined internal event system types
4. Resolved error handling edge cases
5. Added performance measurement methodologies

**Total Specification Changes:** 5 documents updated (SPEC007, SPEC011, SPEC017, SPEC021, SPEC022)

---

## CRITICAL FIX #1: Time Representation Architecture

### Issue
**SPEC017 & SPEC007:** API initially used milliseconds instead of ticks, violating sample-accurate precision architecture.

### Root Cause
Misinterpretation of "human-readable" layer designation. API is developer-facing (not user-facing).

### Fix Applied

**SPEC017-sample_rate_conversion.md:**
- Added section "Time Representation by Layer" [SRC-LAYER-010 through SRC-LAYER-030]
- **Developer-facing layers (use TICKS):**
  - REST API (all wkmp-* endpoints)
  - Database (SQLite tables)
  - Developer UI (shows both ticks AND seconds)
  - SSE Events (internal event fields)
- **User-facing layers (use SECONDS):**
  - End-user UI (web interface for listeners)
  - User-visible displays (playback position, duration)

**SPEC007-api_design.md:**
- Changed all API examples from milliseconds to ticks
- Updated field names: `position_ms` → `position`
- All timing values now `i64` (ticks)

### Impact
✅ **Prevents lossy conversions** between API ↔ Database ↔ Developer UI
✅ **Maintains sample-accurate precision** throughout system
✅ **Simplifies implementation** (no conversion needed in developer layers)

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept this architectural clarification?**
- API uses ticks (i64), not milliseconds
- Only end-user UI shows seconds with decimal precision
- No conversions between developer-facing layers

---

## CRITICAL FIX #2: API Response Contracts

### Issue
**SPEC007 Issue #1:** POST /playback/enqueue response format incomplete - cannot implement endpoint without knowing what to return.

### Fix Applied

Added complete response contract with `applied_timing` field:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "queue_entry_id": "uuid-of-queue-entry",
  "play_order": 30,
  "applied_timing": {
    "start_time": 0,
    "end_time": 6618528000,
    "fade_in_start_time": 0,
    "fade_in_point": 56448000,
    "fade_in_duration": 56448000,
    "fade_out_start_time": 6474752000,
    "fade_out_point": 6562080000,
    "fade_out_duration": 141120000,
    "lead_in_point": 0,
    "lead_out_point": 6618528000,
    "fade_in_curve_type": "equal_power",
    "fade_out_curve_type": "equal_power"
  }
}
```

**All values in TICKS (i64).**

### Impact
✅ **API contract complete** - can implement POST /playback/enqueue
✅ **Client knows actual timing applied** (after defaults/overrides resolved)
✅ **Enables client-side validation** of timing parameters

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept this response format?**
- Returns all 11 timing fields explicitly
- Uses ticks for all timing values
- Includes curve types for transparency

## CRITICAL FIX #3: Security Specifications

### Issue
**SPEC007:** Hash calculation algorithm incomplete, shared secret management undefined, error responses missing.

### Fix Applied

Added 4 new security specifications:

**[API-AUTH-027] Hash Calculation Algorithm:**
```
1. Create JSON with all fields, hash field = 64 zero characters
2. Convert to canonical JSON (alphabetically sorted keys, no whitespace)
3. Append shared secret as decimal i64 string
4. Calculate SHA-256 hash
5. Replace dummy hash with calculated hash (64 hex characters)
```

**[API-AUTH-028] Shared Secret Management:**
- Stored in database settings table (`api_shared_secret`)
- 64-bit signed integer (`i64`)
- Generated via cryptographically secure RNG on first startup
- Rotatable via database update (requires service restart)

**[API-AUTH-029] Error Responses:**
- **401 Unauthorized:** Invalid hash (returns `{"error": "invalid_hash"}`)
- **403 Forbidden:** Timestamp outside window (returns `{"error": "timestamp_out_of_range", "server_time": ...}`)

**[API-AUTH-030] Clock Skew Rationale:**
- Accept 1000ms past, 1ms future
- Rationale: Accommodates network latency while preventing replay attacks

### Impact
✅ **Security implementation fully specified**
✅ **Prevents replay attacks** (timestamp validation)
✅ **Enables message authentication** (SHA-256 with shared secret)

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept security approach?**
- SHA-256 hash with shared 64-bit secret
- 1000ms past / 1ms future tolerance
- Canonical JSON representation for consistent hashing

---

## CRITICAL FIX #4: Event System Internal Types

### Issue
**SPEC011 Issue #1:** MixerStateContext undefined - cannot implement PlaybackPositionChanged event.

### Fix Applied

**[EVT-CTX-010] MixerStateContext enum definition:**
```rust
pub enum MixerStateContext {
    Immediate,
    Crossfading { incoming_queue_entry_id: Uuid },
}
```

**[EVT-ERR-PROP-010/020/030] Error Event Propagation Rules:**
- **First component to detect error emits event** (no cascading)
- Event emission failure is non-fatal (log fallback)
- All errors logged regardless of event success

**[EVT-ORDER-010/020/030] Event Ordering Guarantees:**
- FIFO delivery via tokio::broadcast (65536 buffer)
- No global ordering across event types
- Multi-subscriber support documented

**[EVT-SONG-ALBUMS-010] song_albums field:**
- Array of strings (supports multi-release albums)

### Impact
✅ **Internal event types complete** - can implement event system
✅ **Error propagation clear** - no duplicate error events
✅ **Event ordering defined** - predictable behavior for clients

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept event system design?**
- MixerStateContext enum with 2 variants
- First-error-wins propagation (no cascading)
- FIFO ordering within event type

---

## CRITICAL FIX #5: Error Handling Edge Cases

### Issue
**SPEC021:** Degradation loops undefined, panic recovery incomplete, timeouts hard-coded.

### Fix Applied

**[ERH-RSRC-020] Degradation Loop Limits:**
- **Mode 1 (Reduced Chain Count):** Max 2 reductions (12→6→3)
- If exhaustion at chain_count=3 → transition to Mode 2 (Single Passage Playback)
- Exit condition: 5 minutes stable → increase by one step

**[ERH-DEC-035] 50% Partial Decode Threshold Rationale:**
- ≥50% provides meaningful musical content
- Balances salvageability vs quality
- Industry reference (similar to streaming services)

**[ERH-DEC-045] Decoder Panic Buffer Flush:**
- Flush buffer BEFORE emitting PassageDecoderPanic event
- Event ordering: PassageDecoderPanic → PassageCompleted → PassageStarted
- Chain isolation (panic doesn't affect other chains)

**[ERH-BUF-015] Buffer Underrun Timeout Configurable:**
- Setting: `buffer_underrun_recovery_timeout_ms` in database
- Default: 500ms (validated in Phase 8 on Pi Zero 2W)
- Range: 100ms - 5000ms

### Impact
✅ **Prevents infinite degradation loops**
✅ **Panic recovery safe** (no corrupted audio)
✅ **Timeouts tunable** for platform performance

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept error handling decisions?**
- Max 2 degradation attempts before Mode 2
- 50% threshold for partial decode playback
- Configurable timeouts via database

---

## CRITICAL FIX #6: Performance Measurement Methodologies

### Issue
**SPEC022 Issues #1-4:** Measurement points undefined, CPU calculation unclear, no empirical baseline.

### Fix Applied

**[PERF-MEASURE-010] Initial Playback Start Measurement:**
- **Start:** HTTP POST /playback/enqueue request arrival
- **End:** First PCM sample sent to cpal audio device
- Instrumentation: `std::time::Instant` timestamps

**[PERF-CPU-010] CPU Percentage Calculation:**
- **Aggregate CPU = Sum across 4 cores** (NOT average)
- Example: 25% + 20% + 10% + 5% = 60% aggregate
- Range: 0% (idle) to 400% (all cores 100%)
- Subtract idle baseline to isolate wkmp-ap usage

**[PERF-MEM-010] Memory Baseline Requirement:**
- 150 MB target is ESTIMATE - requires empirical validation
- Measure on Pi Zero 2W during Phase 8 (Performance Validation)
- Update spec if actual variance >20% from estimate

**[PERF-API-010] API Response Time Test Conditions:**
- Single concurrent request (no concurrency stress)
- Localhost (eliminates network latency)
- Database: 1000 passages, queue with 10 entries
- Warmup: Discard first 100 requests

### Impact
✅ **All metrics now measurable** with defined methodologies
✅ **CPU calculation unambiguous** (sum, not average)
✅ **Memory target adjustable** based on empirical data

### Approval Required
❓ **Accept measurement approach?**
- CPU = aggregate sum (can exceed 100%)
- Memory target provisional (adjust in Phase 8)
- Performance tests on actual Pi Zero 2W hardware
