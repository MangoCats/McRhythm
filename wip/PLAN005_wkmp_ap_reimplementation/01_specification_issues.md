## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risk Hierarchy

1. **HIGHEST RISK:** SPEC007 (API Design) - 5 critical issues, missing response contracts
2. **HIGH RISK:** SPEC022 (Performance Targets) - Unmeasurable targets, no baseline
3. **HIGH RISK:** SPEC021 (Error Handling) - Recovery loops undefined
4. **MEDIUM-HIGH RISK:** SPEC011 (Event System) - Internal spec incomplete
5. **MEDIUM RISK:** SPEC002 (Crossfade) - Orthogonality contradiction

---

## Decision: Can Implementation Proceed?

**RECOMMENDATION:** ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION - 18 CRITICAL issues require resolution or explicit acceptance**

### Issues That BLOCK Implementation (MUST Resolve)

**Cannot implement without resolution:**

1. **SPEC007 Issue #1:** POST /playback/enqueue response contract incomplete
   - **Impact:** Cannot implement endpoint without knowing what to return
   - **Resolution Required:** Define response format including applied timing

2. **SPEC022 Issue #1:** Decode latency target unmeasurable
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify if requirement met
   - **Resolution Required:** Define measurement methodology, baseline dataset

3. **SPEC022 Issue #2:** CPU usage target not platform-specific
   - **Impact:** Cannot determine if 30% means sum or average across cores
   - **Resolution Required:** Clarify measurement methodology

4. **SPEC022 Issue #3:** Memory usage target not validated against hardware
   - **Impact:** Target may be impossible or already met
   - **Resolution Required:** Measure actual baseline before finalizing target

5. **SPEC002 Issue #1:** Fade vs Lead orthogonality contradicts implementation algorithm
   - **Impact:** Unclear whether fade curves applied pre-buffer or during mixing
   - **Resolution Required:** Choose one model consistently (recommend orthogonal: fade pre-buffer, lead in timing)

### Issues That Create HIGH RISK (Should Resolve)

**Can proceed with explicit assumptions, but high risk of rework:**

6. **SPEC021 Issue #1:** Undefined recovery for multiple consecutive errors
7. **SPEC021 Issue #3:** Decoder panic recovery missing state validation
8. **SPEC007 Issue #2:** GET /playback/buffer_status implementation details missing
9. **SPEC007 Issue #5:** SSE event stream missing specification (must inline from SPEC011)
10. **SPEC011 Issue #1:** Internal PlaybackEvent definition incomplete (MixerStateContext undefined)
11. **SPEC011 Issue #3:** Event ordering guarantees missing

### Issues Accepted as AT-RISK (Document and Monitor)

**Can proceed with explicit assumptions documented in plan:**

- **SPEC021 Draft Status:** GUIDE002 says "Draft" but actual status is "Approved" - RESOLVED, no longer at risk
- **SPEC017 rubato assumptions:** Already identified in GUIDE002 as AT-RISK with fallback plan
- All MEDIUM and LOW severity issues: Address during implementation or defer to future iterations

## CRITICAL Issues Detail (18 Total)

### SPEC021: Error Handling (4 Critical)

#### Issue #1: Undefined Recovery for Multiple Consecutive Errors
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 996-1024 (Graceful Degradation section)
- **Description:**
  - ERH-DEGRADE-010 specifies "Mode 1: Reduced Chain Count" triggered by file handle exhaustion
  - No specification for what happens if reduced chain count mode itself experiences exhaustion
  - No maximum iteration limit (could loop indefinitely)
  - No exit condition for exiting degraded mode
- **Impact:** System could enter unrecoverable degraded state or infinite retry loops
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  ```
  Add requirement: "Maximum chain reduction is 1 (from maximum_decode_streams to minimum 3).
  If file handle exhaustion occurs at chain_count=3, system transitions to Mode 3
  (single passage) or emits SystemShutdownRequired event."
  ```

#### Issue #2: Partial Decode Threshold Undefined Rationale
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Ambiguity
- **Location:** Lines 161-200 (ERH-DEC-030)
- **Description:**
  - 50% threshold has no documented rationale
  - No data on user acceptability of 50% playback vs. skip
  - No specification for boundary cases (exactly 50.0%, 49.9%, 50.1%)
- **Impact:** Threshold may be wrong; users may prefer different behavior; future changes require re-implementation
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add appendix with rationale: "50% chosen based on [reference study/industry standard]"
  - Add clarification: "For boundary cases, round consistently toward skip"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Accept 50% as reasonable default, can be made configurable in future

#### Issue #3: Decoder Panic Recovery Missing State Validation
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 201-234 (ERH-DEC-040)
- **Description:**
  - "Restart decoder chain" - no specification for what state is lost
  - No definition of what "restart" means (just decoder or entire chain?)
  - No specification for in-flight buffers during panic
  - Can corrupted samples already in buffer be played?
- **Impact:** Silent audio corruption or glitches if corrupted samples played before decoder restarted
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "On decoder panic, immediately flush associated buffer and discard partially decoded samples"
  - Add: "Emit PassageDecoderPanic event BEFORE attempting recovery"

#### Issue #4: Buffer Underrun Recovery Timeout Not Validated
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (Downgraded to HIGH for implementation)
- **Type:** Testability
- **Location:** Lines 240-286 (ERH-BUF-010)
- **Description:**
  - 500ms timeout hard-coded, not configurable
  - No validation against decode_work_period (5000ms) or output_refill_period (90ms)
  - May be too short on Pi Zero 2W
- **Impact:** Recovery may fail on slow hardware
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Make timeout configurable via settings table
  - Default 500ms, validate on Pi Zero 2W during Phase 8
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Proceed with 500ms, measure in Phase 8, make configurable if needed

---

### SPEC002: Crossfade Design (3 Critical)

#### Issue #1: Fade vs Lead Orthogonality Contradicts Implementation
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Consistency
- **Location:** Lines 121-194 vs. Lines 936-949
- **Description:**
  - Section XFD-ORTH-010 through -025 establishes orthogonal concepts:
    - Fade points control volume envelope (applied BEFORE buffering by Fader)
    - Lead points control overlap TIMING (mixer decision)
  - But Implementation Algorithm (XFD-IMPL-020) shows fade-out curve applied DURING mixing
  - Clear contradiction: fade curves pre-buffer or during mixing?
- **Impact:** Implementers will produce incorrect crossfade volume curves
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - **Option A (RECOMMENDED):** Keep orthogonal design - fade applied pre-buffer, only lead points in algorithm
    - Remove fade-out point from crossfade algorithm
    - Lead points ONLY determine timing
  - **Option B:** Merge fade and lead - add fade application to algorithm description
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Choose Option A (orthogonal), update SPEC016 to match

#### Issue #2: Three-Phase Validation Responsibilities Conflict
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (Downgraded to HIGH for implementation)
- **Type:** Consistency
- **Location:** Lines 472-531
- **Description:**
  - Phase 1 (Enqueue): Fail with 400 if invalid
  - Phase 2 (Database Read): Log warning and CORRECT values
  - Phase 3 (Pre-Decode): Skip passage with invalid_timing
  - No precedence specification if conflict occurs
- **Impact:** Unclear error handling
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "Phase 1 prevents invalid entry. Phase 2 only for database corruption. Phase 3 is safety net."
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Implement all three phases; trust Phase 1 validation most

#### Issue #3: Clamping Logic Asymmetry Undocumented
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (Downgraded to MEDIUM for implementation)
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 1023-1085
- **Description:**
  - Defined lead-out "unaffected by clamping" but "unaffected" not defined
  - Can defined lead-out exceed 50% passage duration?
  - Scenarios provide examples but no explicit requirement
- **Impact:** Ambiguous behavior
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "User-defined lead times not clamped and may exceed 50% of passage duration"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Implement per examples (user choice not overridden)

---

### SPEC022: Performance Targets (4 Critical)

#### Issue #1: Decode Latency Target Unmeasurable
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Testability
- **Location:** Lines 42-66
- **Description:**
  - Target: "Initial Playback Start ≤0.1 seconds"
  - No definition of what "initial playback start" measures (from API call? first sample? first heard audio?)
  - No test dataset specification (100 passages? 1000? which formats?)
- **Impact:** Impossible to verify if target met
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "Initial Playback Start = Time from API call arrival to first PCM sample sent to audio device"
  - Add: "Test dataset: 100 diverse passages (FLAC, MP3, Opus, AAC) at tests/performance/test_audio_files/"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Define measurement in Phase 8 test plan, establish baseline empirically

#### Issue #2: CPU Usage Target Not Platform-Specific
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 69-98
- **Description:**
  - "Average Aggregate ≤30%" - 30% of WHAT? 400% total or 100% average?
  - No idle baseline measurement specification
- **Impact:** CPU measurements meaningless without context
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "CPU percentage = (core_time / elapsed_time) × 100 aggregate across 4 cores"
  - Add: "Target is CPU above idle baseline (measure before starting test)"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Define as aggregate sum (30% of 400% = 120% single-core equivalent)

#### Issue #3: Memory Usage Target Not Validated Against Hardware
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 101-130
- **Description:**
  - Target: ≤150 MB total
  - Appendix says "estimate" not measured
  - No baseline from actual implementation
- **Impact:** Target may be impossible or already met
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Measure actual memory on Pi Zero 2W with existing code first
  - Add baseline measurement to spec
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Accept 150MB as design target, measure in Phase 8, adjust if needed

#### Issue #4: API Response Time Percentiles Not Defensible
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Type:** Testability
- **Location:** Lines 164-194
- **Description:**
  - p50: 10ms, p95: 50ms - but what load? 1 request? 100 concurrent?
  - No network latency specification (local? network?)
  - No database state specification (empty? realistic data?)
- **Impact:** p95 response times meaningless without test conditions
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "Load: Single concurrent request (no concurrency)"
  - Add: "Network: Localhost only (127.0.0.1)"
  - Add: "Database: Pre-populated with 1000 passages, 100 in queue"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Define test conditions in Phase 8, measure empirically

- **Description:**
  - "Audio stream continues internally (muted)" mentioned
  - Cross-reference to SPEC002 is wrong (should be SPEC016 DBD-MIX-050)
  - Exponential decay behavior not explained
- **Impact:** Client may not expect muted stream continuing
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add: "Pause mutes output with exponential decay to zero (see SPEC016 DBD-MIX-050)"
  - Correct cross-reference
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Implement per SPEC016, correct documentation reference

#### Issue #4: Audio Device Selection Missing Error Cases
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (Downgraded to HIGH for implementation)
- **Type:** Completeness

- **Impact:** Error handling incomplete
- **Recommended Resolution:**
  - Add error case: "409 Conflict: Device locked by another application"
  - Add error case: "403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions"
  - **IMPLEMENTATION DECISION:** Add error cases as discovered during testing

#### Issue #5: SSE Event Stream Missing Specification
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - **BLOCKS IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Type:** Completeness
- **Location:** Lines 1269-1280
- **Description:**
