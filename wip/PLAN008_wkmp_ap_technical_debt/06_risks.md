## Risk Register

### RISK-001: Authentication Implementation Breaks Existing Clients [HIGH]

**Category:** Technical - Security
**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (blocks production deployment)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Description:**
New POST/PUT authentication may break existing clients that don't send `shared_secret` in request body.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- Existing integrations fail
- Client applications need immediate updates
- Deployment rollback required

**Indicators:**
- Integration tests fail with 401 errors
- Production monitoring shows authentication failures

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. Add comprehensive test suite (6 tests) covering all edge cases
2. Document API changes clearly
3. Provide migration guide for client developers
4. Consider grace period with warning-only mode initially

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Feature flag to disable new auth temporarily
2. Rollback deployment to previous version
3. Expedite client updates with support from team

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Owner:** Sprint 1 implementer
**Status:** Identified

### RISK-002: Refactoring Introduces Regressions [HIGH]

**Category:** Technical - Quality
**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** High (breaks existing functionality)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Description:**
Splitting engine.rs into 3 modules (Increments 18-20) may inadvertently break existing functionality through module visibility issues, circular dependencies, or state management errors.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- Playback failures
- Queue management broken
- Diagnostics incorrect
- Extensive debugging required

**Indicators:**
- Tests fail after refactoring
- Compiler errors about private items
- Runtime panics or unexpected behavior

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. **Incremental approach:** Extract one module at a time
2. **Test after each step:** Run full test suite after each module extraction
3. **Keep public API unchanged:** Verify API compatibility
4. **Code review:** Careful review of module boundaries
5. **Backup:** Commit before each extraction for easy rollback

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Revert to pre-refactoring commit
2. Re-approach refactoring with smaller scope
3. Defer engine.rs refactoring to separate effort if needed

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Owner:** Sprint 3 implementer
**Status:** Identified

### RISK-003: Telemetry Queries Impact Performance [MEDIUM]

**Category:** Technical - Performance
**Probability:** Low (20%)
**Impact:** Medium (UI sluggish, overhead)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Querying decoder worker telemetry on every `get_buffer_chain_state()` call may add measurable latency if developer UI polls frequently or decoder pool locked.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- Developer UI response time >500ms
- Audio thread affected by lock contention
- User experience degraded

**Indicators:**
- Performance profiling shows telemetry query hot spots
- UI lag noticeable when diagnostics panel open
- Lock contention metrics increased

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. Use lock-free reads (Arc<RwLock> with read())
2. Async queries (don't block caller)
3. Profile before/after implementation
4. Set performance budget: <10ms per query

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Add caching layer (100ms TTL)
2. Reduce UI polling frequency
3. Make telemetry opt-in (only when diagnostics open)

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW
**Owner:** Sprint 2 implementer
**Status:** Identified

### RISK-004: Schedule Slippage Due to Underestimation [MEDIUM]

**Category:** Project Management - Schedule
**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (delayed delivery)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Effort estimates may be optimistic, particularly for Sprint 3 refactoring (11 hours estimated). Actual effort could exceed estimates.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- 3-week deadline missed
- Stakeholder expectations not met
- Follow-on work delayed

**Indicators:**
- >4 hours behind schedule at checkpoints
- Increments taking 2x estimated time
- Contingency exhausted before Sprint 3

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. 24% contingency allocated (12 hours)
2. Track velocity daily
3. Checkpoint reviews catch slippage early
4. Prioritize Sprint 1 (security-critical)

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Use contingency hours (12h available)
2. Defer Sprint 3 if needed (code health non-blocking)
3. Add developer for Sprint 3 refactoring
4. Reduce scope (skip clipping logs, defer warnings)

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Owner:** Project manager/tech lead
**Status:** Identified

---

### RISK-005: Integration Test Failures [MEDIUM]

**Category:** Technical - Testing
**Probability:** Low (20%)
**Impact:** Medium (delays deployment)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
New code may pass unit tests but fail integration tests due to interactions with other components not captured in isolated tests.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- Additional debugging time required
- Deployment delayed
- May need rework of implementation

**Indicators:**
- Unit tests pass but integration tests fail
- Real playback scenarios exhibit issues
- End-to-end tests timeout or error

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. Integration tests at each checkpoint
2. Test with real audio files
3. Manual testing of critical paths
4. Checkpoint criteria include integration tests

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Debug with detailed logging
2. Add integration test coverage for gaps
3. Use contingency hours for fixes

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW
**Owner:** Each sprint implementer
**Status:** Identified

### RISK-006: Decoder Telemetry Infrastructure Complexity [MEDIUM]

**Category:** Technical - Implementation
**Probability:** Low (15%)
**Impact:** Medium (delays Sprint 2)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Creating DecoderTelemetry struct and wiring through decoder workers may be more complex than estimated if decoder pool architecture has unforeseen constraints.

**Impact If Occurs:**
- Increment 08 takes longer than 3h estimate
- May require decoder pool refactoring
- Sprint 2 timeline at risk

**Indicators:**
- Decoder pool doesn't expose worker handles
- Telemetry lifetime management complex
- Threading issues with telemetry access

**Mitigation (Proactive):**
1. Review decoder pool architecture before starting
2. Allocate contingency if needed
3. Simplify approach (e.g., best-effort telemetry, optional fields)

**Contingency (Reactive):**
1. Use simpler telemetry approach (cache in engine)
2. Skip some telemetry fields if blocking
3. Use 3h from contingency

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW
**Owner:** Sprint 2 implementer
**Status:** Identified

## Risk Monitoring

**Daily Checks:**
- [ ] Velocity tracking (on schedule?)
- [ ] Test pass rate (any failures?)
- [ ] Blockers identified

**Weekly Checks (at Checkpoints):**
- [ ] All checkpoint criteria met
- [ ] Risks materialized or resolved
- [ ] Contingency usage tracked
- [ ] Schedule status (on track / slipping)

**Escalation Criteria:**
- 2 consecutive days >2h behind schedule → alert tech lead
- Critical test failures → pause implementation, debug
- Contingency >50% consumed before Sprint 3 → reassess plan

---

## Risk Response Planning

### If HIGH Risk Materializes

**Response Team:**
- Lead developer (implementer)
- Tech lead (code review / architecture guidance)
- Project manager (schedule / scope decisions)

**Process:**
1. Stop current work
2. Assess impact and root cause
3. Implement contingency plan
4. Adjust plan if needed
5. Resume work

**Decision Authority:**
- Minor adjustments: Lead developer
- Scope changes: Tech lead
- Schedule changes: Project manager

---

### If Multiple Risks Materialize

**Escalation Path:**
1. Assess cumulative impact
2. Prioritize risks by severity
3. Consider scope reduction:
   - MUST have: Sprint 1 (security)
   - SHOULD have: Sprint 2 (functionality)
   - NICE to have: Sprint 3 (code health)

4. Communicate revised plan to stakeholders
