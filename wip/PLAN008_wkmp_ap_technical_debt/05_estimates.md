## Estimation Methodology

### Bottom-Up Estimation

**Basis:** Each increment estimated individually based on:
1. Complexity of implementation
2. Lines of code to modify
3. Number of tests to write
4. Risk level (high-risk = extra buffer)

**Calibration:** Estimates based on:
- Historical wkmp-ap development velocity
- Similar refactoring efforts
- Authentication middleware complexity

### Contingency Calculation

**Base Contingency:** 20% (standard for technical debt remediation)
**Additional Risk Buffer:** +4% for Sprint 3 refactoring

**Total Contingency:** 24%

**Rationale:**
- Sprint 1-2: Lower risk (straightforward additions)
- Sprint 3: Higher risk (large-scale refactoring)

└── Checkpoint 1

Week 2: Sprint 2 (Functionality & Diagnostics)
├── Mon-Tue: Increments 8-9 (Telemetry)
├── Wed: Increments 10-12 (Albums)
├── Thu: Increments 13-14 (Duration)
├── Fri: Increment 15 (Cleanup)
└── Checkpoint 2

Week 3: Sprint 3 (Code Health)

```

**Key Milestones:**
- End of Week 1: Authentication fixed (security vulnerability eliminated)
- End of Week 2: All functionality complete
- End of Week 3: Code quality improved, ready for release

---

## Resource Requirements

### Personnel

**Primary:** 1 Senior Rust Developer (full-time, 3 weeks)
- Experience with: Rust, Axum, async/await, audio processing
- Responsibilities: Implementation, testing, code review

**Secondary:** 1 Tech Lead (part-time, code review only)
- 2 hours per sprint for code review
- Total: 6 hours over 3 weeks

**Total Labor:** 62h developer + 6h lead = 68 hours

---

### Infrastructure

**Development Environment:**
- Linux/macOS development machine
- Rust stable toolchain
- Audio output device (for playback testing)

**Testing Environment:**
- Same as development (local testing sufficient)

**No additional infrastructure required**

---

### External Dependencies

**None** - All work uses existing libraries and infrastructure

---

## Confidence Levels

### Sprint 1 Estimates: HIGH Confidence

**Rationale:**
- Authentication patterns well-understood
- Similar code exists (GET auth)
- Clear requirements

**Risk of Overrun:** Low (10%)

---

### Sprint 2 Estimates: HIGH Confidence

**Rationale:**
- Database queries straightforward
- Event modifications simple
- Clear test criteria

**Risk of Overrun:** Low (10%)

---

### Sprint 3 Estimates: MEDIUM Confidence

**Rationale:**
- Refactoring size significant
- Potential for unforeseen dependencies
- Higher complexity

**Risk of Overrun:** Medium (30%)

**Mitigation:** 24% contingency allocated, with majority (10 of 12 hours) in Sprint 3

---

## Assumptions

**Key Assumptions Affecting Estimates:**

1. **No Scope Creep**
   - Only 37 requirements implemented
   - No additional features discovered during implementation

2. **No Major Blockers**
   - All dependencies available
   - No environment issues
   - No team member unavailability

3. **Test Infrastructure Works**
   - Existing test harness functional
   - Can write tests without framework changes

4. **Single Developer**
   - No coordination overhead
   - No merge conflicts
   - Full focus on this work

5. **Technical Competence**
   - Developer experienced with Rust, Axum, async
   - No learning curve for technologies used

---

## Contingency Allocation

**Total Contingency: 12 hours**

**Allocation by Sprint:**
- Sprint 1: 4 hours (27% contingency on 15h base)
- Sprint 2: 3 hours (21% contingency on 14h base)
- Sprint 3: 5 hours (24% contingency on 21h base)

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Use for unforeseen complexity
- Use for additional testing if issues found
- Do NOT use for scope additions

---

## Velocity Tracking

**Recommended Metrics:**

Track daily:
- Increments completed
- Hours spent
- Tests passing
- Blockers encountered

**Expected Velocity:**
- Week 1: 7 increments (15h base)
- Week 2: 8 increments (14h base)
- Week 3: 7 increments (21h base)

**Alert Threshold:** If >4 hours behind schedule at any checkpoint, reassess plan

---

## Cost Estimate

**Labor Cost:**
- Developer: 62h × $rate
- Tech Lead: 6h × $rate

**Total Cost:** (62 + 6) × $rate = 68 hours × $rate

**Non-Labor Costs:** $0 (no additional infrastructure, tools, or licenses)

---

## Schedule Risk Analysis

**Critical Path:** Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 (linear, no parallelization)

**Schedule Risks:**
1. **Sprint 1 delay:** Blocks all subsequent work (HIGH impact)
2. **Sprint 3 overrun:** Refactoring takes longer than estimated (MEDIUM probability)

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize Sprint 1 completion
- Allocate majority of contingency to Sprint 3

**Buffer:** 12 hours contingency provides:
- 2.4 hours per week buffer
- ~1 day total slack

---

## Delivery Confidence

**Overall Confidence: HIGH (80%)**

**Rationale:**
- Clear requirements
- Experienced team
- Appropriate contingency
- Incremental approach with checkpoints

**Risk of Missing 3-Week Deadline:** Low (20%)

**If Deadline at Risk:**
- Option 1: Use contingency hours
- Option 2: Defer Sprint 3 (code health) to separate effort
- Option 3: Add developer for Sprint 3 (parallel refactoring tasks)

---

## Phase 6 Summary

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Base effort: 50 hours
- ✅ Contingency: 12 hours (24%)
- ✅ Total: 62 hours
- ✅ Timeline: 3 weeks
- ✅ Confidence: HIGH (80%)
- ✅ Resource requirements defined
- ✅ Schedule risk analyzed
