## Problems

### Problem 1: Implementation overlooks specifications

**Observed Behavior:**
Specification clearly call for certain things to be implemented certain ways, but actual implementation varies without notice of the deviations.

**Expected Behavior:**
Processes should follow their documented governance, final product should implement requirements using the architecture and design elements specified.

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Affected Components:** All
- **User Impact:** Product does not meet expectations or requirements
- **Regulatory Impact:** Extensive review, testing and remediation by humans required for AI generated solutions

**Investigation Done So Far:**
This is a recurring problem with AI generated software solutions.

**Suspected Root Causes:**
Information overload, documentation volume exceeds context window capacity and organization does not help reduce context related issues.

---

### Problem 2: AI authored documents are relatively bloated, verbose, redundant, and overly long.

**Observed Behavior:** Each time an AI agent is requested to revise a document, the document becomes significantly more larger than it needs to be to achieve the objective.

**Expected Behavior:** Succinct, clear, concise, unambiguous, even terse edits which contain the required information without burying the reader in detail.  Where detail is called for, reference other documents containing the detail but keep the higher level documents free of unnecessary clutter, readers can drill down as needed, when needed.

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Affected Components:** All

## Research Areas

### Research Topics: Context Engineering, Hierarchical context management, cognitive architectures, Orchestration and tool use, Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Why Research is Needed:**
This is a rapidly evolving field and the default tool deployments aren't up to speed with current best practices.

**Specific Questions:**
- What effective context engineering methodolgies might improve performance of AI assistants within this project?

**Application to Project:**
Both .claude/commands workflows and project documentation practices and structures.

## After Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-25
**Analysis Method:** `/think` Multi-Agent Workflow (8-Phase Analysis)
**Analysis Output:** [wip/context_engineering_analysis_results.md](context_engineering_analysis_results.md)

### Quick Summary

**Both problems validated by research; WKMP already has designed solutions (need adoption):**

**Problem 1 (Implementation overlooks specs) - Root causes identified:**
- Context window overload (confirmed: "most agent failures are context failures")
- Information accessibility challenges across multiple documents
- Lack of systematic traceability enforcement

**Problem 2 (AI document verbosity) - Root causes identified:**
- AI default behavior (favors completeness over conciseness)
- Missing verbosity constraints in older workflows
- Progressive disclosure not consistently applied

**Critical Finding:** WKMP's `/think` and `/plan` workflows (added 2025-10-25) ALREADY address both problems with context window management and specification verification, but are brand new (zero proof yet).

**Options Analyzed:** 7 approaches
1. Automated traceability verification (Medium effort, moderate impact)
2. Hierarchical context loading (High effort, high impact if successful)
3. **Adopt `/plan` workflow** (Low effort, high impact - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
4. **Explicit verbosity constraints** (Low effort, high impact - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
5. **Mandatory modular structure** (Medium effort, high impact - HIGH PRIORITY)
6. Document refactoring (High effort, deferred to Phase 3)
7. **Summary-first reading pattern** (Low effort, moderate impact - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Recommendation:** Phased approach
- **Phase 1 (Immediate):** 4 interventions (13.5-17.5 hours total)
  1. Mandate `/plan` workflow for features >5 requirements
  2. Add verbosity constraints to CLAUDE.md (target 20-40% reduction)
  3. Mandate summary-first reading protocol
  4. Require modular structure for new docs >300 lines
- **Expected Impact:** 20-40% reduction in document size, proactive specification verification, gradual improvement

**Research Support:** Strong alignment with 2024-2025 best practices
- Hierarchical Context Architecture (HCA)
- Token efficiency (20-40% reduction possible)
- RAG evaluation frameworks
- Dynamic context loading
- Modular documentation patterns

**Key Findings:**
- WKMP workflows already implement many best practices (5-tier hierarchy, requirement enumeration, context window management)
- Recent `/think` and `/plan` workflows address core problems directly
- Low-hanging fruit: adopt existing tools + prompt engineering = immediate gains
- Context engineering is validated, rapidly evolving field

**Decisions Required:**
1. Mandatory `/plan` threshold? (>5 requirements? >10? Team discretion?)
2. Verbosity constraint aggressiveness level?
3. Legacy document migration strategy? (Refactor now or wait?)
4. GOV001 update authority and timeline?
