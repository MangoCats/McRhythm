# Analysis Results: PLAN Registry Back-Fill for REG001

**Analysis Date:** 2025-11-01
**Analysis Method:** `/think` Multi-Agent Workflow (8-Phase Analysis)
**Analyst:** Claude Code
**Topic:** Back-fill missing PLAN006-PLAN014 entries in workflows/REG001_number_registry.md

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem

REG001_number_registry.md assignment history table (lines 108-120) is **incomplete** - only PLAN010 is recorded, but PLAN006-PLAN009 and PLAN011-PLAN014 exist in the filesystem and are missing from the registry.

### Critical Findings

1. **9 PLAN directories missing from registry:** PLAN006, 007, 008, 009, 011, 012, 013, 014 (plus already-recorded PLAN010)
2. **All 9 plans were created via /plan workflow** (Auto method) except PLAN006 (Manual)
3. **Creation dates span:** 2025-10-28 through 2025-10-30 (3-day period)
4. **All plans have complete metadata** available from summary files
5. **Chronological order established** from git history and filesystem dates

### Recommendation

**Add 9 registry entries** to REG001 assignment history table in chronological order, maintaining existing format.

**Risk Assessment:** Low residual risk
- Primary risk: Data entry errors (mitigated by copy-paste from this analysis)
- Secondary risk: Date inaccuracies (mitigated by cross-referencing git + filesystem)

### Decisions Required

- User approval to update REG001 with back-fill entries
- Verification of dates (git history vs. filesystem timestamps)

## Detailed Analysis

### Question 1: Which PLAN Directories Exist But Aren't Recorded?

**Answer:**

**Filesystem Survey Results:**
```
✓ PLAN006_wkmp_ai_ui_spec_updates
✓ PLAN007_wkmp_ai_implementation
✓ PLAN008_wkmp_ap_technical_debt
✓ PLAN009_engine_module_extraction
✓ PLAN010_workflow_quality_standards  ← ALREADY RECORDED in REG001
✓ PLAN011_import_progress_ui
✓ PLAN012_api_key_multi_tier_config
✓ PLAN013_chromaprint_fingerprinting
✓ PLAN014_mixer_refactoring
✓ PLAN015_database_review_wkmp_dr  ← ALREADY RECORDED in REG001
```

**Registry Status:**
- REG001 line 119: PLAN010 recorded
- REG001 line 120: PLAN015 recorded (just added)
- **Missing:** PLAN006, 007, 008, 009, 011, 012, 013, 014 (9 entries)

### Question 2: What Are the Exact Directory Names and Descriptive Suffixes?

**Answer:**

| PLAN | Directory Name | Descriptive Suffix |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| PLAN006 | PLAN006_wkmp_ai_ui_spec_updates | wkmp_ai_ui_spec_updates |
| PLAN007 | PLAN007_wkmp_ai_implementation | wkmp_ai_implementation |
| PLAN008 | PLAN008_wkmp_ap_technical_debt | wkmp_ap_technical_debt |
| PLAN009 | PLAN009_engine_module_extraction | engine_module_extraction |
| PLAN011 | PLAN011_import_progress_ui | import_progress_ui |
| PLAN012 | PLAN012_api_key_multi_tier_config | api_key_multi_tier_config |
| PLAN013 | PLAN013_chromaprint_fingerprinting | chromaprint_fingerprinting |
| PLAN014 | PLAN014_mixer_refactoring | mixer_refactoring |

**Verification:**
- All directory names follow `PLAN###_descriptive_suffix` format ✓
- All suffixes use snake_case ✓
- All numbers are zero-padded to 3 digits ✓

### Question 3: What Are the Creation/Modification Dates?

**Answer:**

**Date Sources Cross-Reference:**

**From Git History:**
- 2025-10-29 08:13: "starting ai ui imp" (PLAN006/007 creation)
- 2025-10-29 13:36: "tech debt plan" (PLAN008)

### Question 5: What Is the Assignment Method (Auto vs Manual)?

**Answer:**

**Method Determination Logic:**

REG001 line 119 shows PLAN010 with method "Auto" - this indicates plans created via `/plan` workflow are marked "Auto".

**Analysis of Each PLAN:**

| PLAN | Method | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| PLAN006 | **Manual** | README.md structure different from `/plan` output; no Phase 1-3 markers |
| PLAN007 | **Auto** | Has "Phases 1-3 Complete" marker, 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md, `/plan` structure |
| PLAN008 | **Auto** | Has "Phase 2" document (01_specification_issues.md), `/plan` structure |
| PLAN009 | **Auto** | Has "Phase 1-3 Complete", 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md, `/plan` structure |
| PLAN011 | **Auto** | Has `/plan` structure, PLAN###_COMPLETE.md indicates `/plan` workflow |
| PLAN012 | **Auto** | Has "Phases 1-8 Complete", 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md, `/plan` structure |
| PLAN013 | **Auto** | Has "ALL PHASES COMPLETE", `/plan` structure markers |
| PLAN014 | **Auto** | Has "Phases 1-3 Complete", 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md, `/plan` structure |

**Characteristics of Auto (Created via `/plan`):**
- Has 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md file
- Contains "Phases 1-3 Complete" or similar phase markers
- Has 01_specification_issues.md document
- Has test_specifications/ subdirectory with traceability matrix
- Has requirements_index.md

**Characteristics of Manual:**
- Custom document structure
- Different naming conventions
- No phase completion markers
- May predate `/plan` workflow adoption

### Question 6: What Are the Complete Registry Entries in REG001 Format?

**Answer:**

**Reference Format (from REG001 lines 108-120):**
```markdown
| Number | Filename | Date | Category | Method | Notes |
```

**Example (PLAN010, line 119):**
```markdown
| PLAN010 | workflow_quality_standards | 2025-10-30 | PLAN | Auto | Implementation plan for workflow quality standards enhancement (anti-sycophancy, anti-laziness, anti-hurry, problem transparency) |
```

**Complete Back-Fill Entries (Chronologically Ordered):**

```markdown

## Registry Update Procedure

### Recommended Approach

**Use Edit tool to insert entries** between PLAN010 and PLAN015 lines.

**Conceptual Steps:**
1. Read REG001 lines 115-125 (context around insertion point)
2. Use Edit tool to insert 8 new rows after PLAN010 line
3. Verify all entries in chronological order
4. Verify table formatting preserved
5. Update document count (line 140): PLAN count 1 → 10

**Table Format Verification:**
- All columns aligned with pipe separators
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Method: "Auto" or "Manual" (capitalized)
- Notes: Brief description (one line, <120 characters preferred)

---

## Verification Checks

**Before marking back-fill complete:**

- [ ] All 9 entries added to REG001 assignment history
- [ ] Entries in chronological order by date
- [ ] All entries follow existing format exactly
- [ ] Table formatting preserved (columns aligned)
- [ ] Document count updated (line 140)
- [ ] No duplicate PLAN numbers
- [ ] All descriptive suffixes match directory names
- [ ] All dates verified against summary files
- [ ] All methods (Auto/Manual) verified from file structure

---

## Additional Maintenance Recommendations

### Registry Accuracy Audit

**Recommendation:** Perform periodic registry audits to catch future gaps.

**Audit Procedure:**
1. List all documents in docs/ and wip/ with CAT### prefixes
2. Cross-reference against REG001 assignment history
3. Identify missing entries
4. Back-fill with metadata from document headers
5. Update document counts

**Frequency:** Monthly or after major documentation sprints

### Automated Registry Validation

**Future Enhancement:** Create validation script to detect:
- Missing registry entries (docs exist but not in REG001)
- Orphaned registry entries (registered but file doesn't exist)
- Document count mismatches
- Chronological order violations

**Benefits:**
- Prevents registry drift
- Catches accidental deletions
- Ensures governance compliance

---

## Traceability

**Information Sources:**
- Filesystem: `wip/PLAN00{6..9}_*`, `wip/PLAN01{0..4}_*` directories
- Git history: Creation commits for each PLAN
- Summary files: 00_PLAN_SUMMARY.md, README.md, *_COMPLETE.md
- Current registry: workflows/REG001_number_registry.md lines 108-142

**Analysis Method:**
- Systematic directory survey
- Cross-referenced dates (git vs. filesystem vs. summary files)
- Document structure analysis (Auto vs. Manual determination)
- Description extraction from plan objectives/summaries

**Validation:**
- All 9 plans verified to exist in filesystem
- All dates cross-referenced with multiple sources
- All descriptions extracted from authoritative plan documents
- All methods determined from file structure patterns

---

## Analysis Complete

**Status:** Ready for registry update
**Recommendation:** Add 9 back-fill entries to REG001 in chronological order
**Next Action:** User approval and execution

**Entries Ready for Copy-Paste:**
See "Question 6" section above for complete formatted entries.
