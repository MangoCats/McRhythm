## APPROACH 1: Implement with Current Specifications (Accept Gaps)

### Description

Proceed with implementation using existing specifications as-is, making pragmatic implementation decisions where specifications are incomplete or ambiguous.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Audio Pipeline (Weeks 1-4)**
- Implement tick-based timing system (SPEC017) - well-specified
- Implement fade curve algorithms (SPEC002) - well-specified
- Implement decoder-buffer chain (SPEC016) - mostly well-specified
  - **Gap Decision:** Use PassageBuffer as core data structure, wrap in lifecycle manager
- Implement mixer state machine (SPEC018)
  - **Gap Decision:** Guess at crossfade completion signaling approach (e.g., mixer returns completion event on each mix() call)

**Phase 2: Queue and Persistence (Weeks 4-6)**
- Implement queue manager (IMPL001 schema)
  - **Gap Decision:** Persist queue eagerly (every enqueue/dequeue operation writes to database)
  - **Gap Decision:** On startup, restore queue from database and rebuild chain assignments
- Implement buffer management
  - **Gap Decision:** Always use incremental decode (pause when buffer full, resume when space available)

**Phase 3: Error Handling (Weeks 6-7)**
- Implement ad-hoc error handling following Rust best practices
  - **Gap Decision:** Decode errors → skip passage + emit error event + log warning
  - **Gap Decision:** Buffer underruns → pause playback + log error + attempt refill
  - **Gap Decision:** Device failures → pause playback + emit error event + await reconnection
  - **Gap Decision:** Queue inconsistencies → remove invalid entry + log error + continue

**Phase 4: API and Integration (Weeks 7-10)**
- Implement HTTP/SSE endpoints (SPEC007)
- Integrate with event system (SPEC011)
- End-to-end testing
  - **Gap:** No performance targets - test on Pi Zero 2W empirically and note observed performance

### Advantages

1. **Fastest Time-to-Implementation:** 8-10 weeks (no specification work delays)
2. **Avoids Analysis Paralysis:** Prevents over-specification of details that may prove wrong during implementation
3. **Leverages Existing Specifications:** Substantial work already done (tick system, crossfades, entity model)
4. **Real Implementation Experience:** Reveals true specification gaps through actual coding
5. **Many Gaps Are Implementation Details:** Terminology, buffer strategy, resampler state management don't affect core architecture

### Disadvantages

1. **Architectural Mismatch Risk:** Gap-filling decisions may conflict with unstated design intent (e.g., SPEC018 crossfade completion signaling)
2. **SPEC018 Critical Uncertainty:** Draft status creates risk of implementing incorrect queue advancement logic
3. **Error Handling Strategy Undefined:** Ad-hoc approach may not match project's error handling conventions or user expectations
4. **Rework Likely:** If gap-filling decisions contradict future specification updates, significant refactoring required
5. **Performance Validation Impossible:** No targets means cannot determine if implementation succeeds on Pi Zero 2W
6. **Contradicts /plan Workflow:** CLAUDE.md mandates `/plan` for >5 requirements; wkmp-ap has dozens of requirements

### Technical Considerations

**Well-Specified Areas (Immediate Implementation):**
- Tick-based timing (SPEC017) - complete formulas
- Fade curves (SPEC002) - mathematical definitions
- Crossfade timing model (SPEC002) - 6-point constraints
- Entity model (REQ002) - Rust structs derivable
- Database schema (IMPL001) - CREATE TABLE statements ready

**Gap-Filling Required:**
- SPEC018 crossfade completion - **HIGH RISK** guess
- Error handling - follows Rust/Tokio patterns but may mismatch project expectations
- Queue persistence timing - eager approach reasonable but not specified
- Buffer strategy - incremental decode sensible but not specified
- Performance - empirical measurement on Pi Zero 2W after implementation

**SPEC014 Contradiction:**
- Implement serial decode per SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040]
- Ignore SPEC014 parallel decoder pool sections (outdated)

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 8-10 weeks** (per GUIDE001 baseline)

Breakdown:
- Weeks 1-4: Core audio pipeline (decoder, fader, mixer, timing)
- Weeks 4-6: Queue manager, persistence, buffer management
- Weeks 6-7: Ad-hoc error handling
- Weeks 7-10: API endpoints, SSE, integration testing

**Rework Risk:** +20-40% additional time if gap-filling decisions prove incorrect

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Critical Risks:**
1. **SPEC018 Draft Status (CRITICAL):**
   - Risk: Implement wrong crossfade completion signaling approach
   - Impact: Queue advancement bugs, incorrect playback sequence
   - Mitigation: Review SPEC018 carefully, implement simplest solution, prepare for refactor

2. **Error Handling Mismatch (HIGH):**
   - Risk: Ad-hoc error handling doesn't match project conventions
   - Impact: Inconsistent error behavior, poor user experience
   - Mitigation: Follow Rust best practices, emit events for all errors, log comprehensively

3. **Performance Failure on Pi Zero 2W (MEDIUM):**
   - Risk: Implementation too CPU/memory intensive for target hardware
   - Impact: Cannot deploy on intended platform
   - Mitigation: Early testing on Pi Zero 2W, profile and optimize as needed

4. **Specification Contradiction Discovery (MEDIUM):**
   - Risk: Later discover SPEC014/SPEC016 contradictions affect more than just decoder
   - Impact: Confusion, misimplementation
   - Mitigation: Treat SPEC016 as authoritative for all decoder-buffer-mixer design

**Residual Risks:**
- Unknown unknowns from unspecified areas
- Potential for cascading rework if core assumptions prove wrong

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-preserved
- Single-stream playback with tick-based timing per SPEC013/SPEC016/SPEC017
- Crossfade timing model per SPEC002
- Entity model per REQ002

**Peripheral Architecture:** Ad-hoc
- Error handling strategy emerges from implementation
- Performance characteristics discovered empirically
- Queue persistence strategy pragmatic but not designed

**Risk of Inconsistency:** Medium - core is solid, peripherals may not integrate cleanly

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: POOR**

**CLAUDE.md Mandate:**
> "For all features requiring >5 requirements OR novel/complex features:
> - MUST run `/plan [specification_document]` before implementing"

- wkmp-ap has dozens of requirements across REQ001, REQ002, multiple SPEC documents
- wkmp-ap is novel/complex (sample-accurate crossfading, tick-based timing)
- Approach 1 violates `/plan` workflow mandate

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems with existing implementation"
- Suggests prior implementation suffered from specification gaps
- Approach 1 risks repeating prior mistakes

**Documentation Framework:**
- WKMP has rigorous 5-tier hierarchy (GOV001)
- Project values specification-driven development
- Approach 1 undermines specification discipline

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Timeline is extremely constrained (must ship in 8-10 weeks)
- Prior implementation problems were not specification-related
- Decision authority accepts gap-filling risk
- Prototype/experimental implementation (not production)

**Not Appropriate If:**
- Prior implementation failed due to specification gaps (likely given user's context)
- Production-quality implementation required
- Risk tolerance is low
- Project adherence to /plan workflow valued

---

## APPROACH 2: Specification Completion Before Implementation

### Description

Systematically address all identified gaps and ambiguities in specifications before implementation begins. Update SPEC documents to provide complete, unambiguous implementation guidance.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Specification Gap Resolution (Weeks 1-4)**

**Week 1: Critical Gaps**
1. **SPEC018 Formal Review and Approval**
   - Conduct detailed review of SPEC018 crossfade completion solution
   - Evaluate proposed signaling mechanism
   - Approve or revise specification
   - Update document status to "Approved"
   - If revisions needed, iterate until approved

2. **Error Handling Strategy Specification**
   - Create comprehensive error taxonomy:
     - Decode errors (file corrupted, unsupported codec, partial decode)
     - Buffer errors (underrun, allocation failure)
     - Device errors (disconnected, unavailable, configuration failure)
     - Queue errors (invalid passage, file not found, chain exhaustion)
     - Resampling errors (conversion failure, invalid rate)
   - Define per-category handling strategies:
     - Fatal (halt playback, require user intervention)
     - Recoverable (retry, skip, fallback)
     - Degraded (log, continue with reduced functionality)
   - Specify event emissions for each error type
   - Define user notification triggers
   - Specify logging requirements
   - Define graceful degradation behaviors

**Week 2: High-Priority Gaps**
3. **Performance Target Specification**
   - Research Pi Zero 2W capabilities (CPU, memory, I/O)
   - Define quantified targets:
     - Decode latency: Buffer fills in <1s for 15s buffer
     - CPU usage: <60% average, <85% peak (single core)
     - Memory limit: Total app <150 MB
     - API response time: <50ms for control endpoints
     - Skip command latency: <100ms
   - Create performance test specifications
   - Define measurement methodologies

4. **SPEC014 Update or Archive**
   - **Option A:** Rewrite SPEC014 decoder sections to match SPEC016 serial decode
   - **Option B:** Move parallel decoder content to archive, add forward reference to SPEC016
   - Eliminate contradiction between SPEC014 and SPEC016

**Week 3: Medium-Priority Gaps**
5. **Queue Persistence Strategy**
   - Specify when queue is persisted:
     - Eager persistence: Every enqueue/dequeue operation writes to database
     - Lazy persistence: Periodic writes (every 5 seconds)
     - Shutdown persistence: Only on graceful shutdown
   - Specify restart reconciliation logic:
     - Load queue from database
     - Rebuild chain assignments based on queue position
     - Validate passage and file existence
     - Remove invalid entries
   - Specify consistency guarantees (eventual consistency acceptable?)

6. **Buffer Decode Strategy**
   - Specify full vs incremental decode decision logic:
     - Option A: Always incremental (pause when buffer full, resume when space available)
     - Option B: Full decode for passages <15s, incremental for longer
     - Option C: Based on queue depth (full for immediate playback, incremental for prefetch)
   - Specify resumption behavior
   - Specify buffer fill prioritization (currently playing > next > prefetch)

**Week 4: Low-Priority Gaps + Documentation**
7. **Terminology Reconciliation**
   - Clarify PassageBuffer vs ManagedBuffer vs DecoderChain
   - Update SPEC016 to define all three types and their relationships
   - Ensure consistent usage across all documents

8. **Resampler State Management**
   - Specify StatefulResampler initialization
   - Specify flush behavior (prevent buffer tail loss)
   - Specify edge case handling (sample rate change mid-file)

9. **Cross-Document Review**
   - Verify all SPEC documents consistent after updates
   - Update cross-references as needed
   - Ensure REQ traceability preserved

**Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 5-14)**
- Follow GUIDE001 phased implementation plan
- Implement with complete specifications (no gap-filling required)
- Unit tests for all components (specs provide test cases)
- Integration tests based on acceptance criteria
- Performance validation against specified targets

### Advantages

1. **Reduced Rework Risk:** Decisions made upfront with full context, minimal refactoring needed
2. **Comprehensive Error Strategy:** Error handling designed proactively, consistent behavior
3. **Performance Targets Defined:** Measurable success criteria, validation possible
4. **SPEC018 Status Resolved:** Critical crossfade coordination clarified and approved
5. **Documentation Updated:** SPEC014 contradiction eliminated, terminology consistent
6. **Aligns with /plan Workflow:** Satisfies CLAUDE.md mandate for complex features
7. **Testability:** Complete specs enable comprehensive test suite design
8. **Confidence:** Implementation proceeds with high certainty, low anxiety about unknowns

### Disadvantages

1. **Slower Time-to-Implementation:** 12-14 weeks total (2-4 weeks spec work + 8-10 weeks coding)
2. **Risk of Over-Specification:** Some details may be better discovered through implementation
3. **Requires Decision Authority:** Specification updates need approval from project stakeholders
4. **May Reveal More Gaps:** Systematic gap analysis may uncover additional issues requiring specification
5. **Specification Quality Risk:** Incorrect decisions made during spec work could be worse than pragmatic implementation decisions

### Technical Considerations

**Specification Updates:**
- Follow GOV001 document hierarchy (update Tier 2 SPEC, Tier 3 IMPL as needed)
- Maintain requirement traceability (GOV002 enumeration)
- Create REV### document to record specification changes

**Error Handling Research:**
- Research industry best practices (how do other audio players handle errors?)
- Review Rust/Tokio error handling patterns
- Consider user experience (what should user see when errors occur?)

**Performance Research:**
- Profile existing audio applications on Pi Zero 2W
- Understand Pi Zero 2W I/O characteristics (SD card, USB, network)
- Research symphonia/rubato performance characteristics

**SPEC018 Decision:**
- Review mixer state machine (None/SinglePassage/Crossfading)
- Evaluate completion signaling options:
  - Option A: Mixer returns completion event on each mix() call
  - Option B: Mixer emits completion via event bus
  - Option C: Engine polls mixer for completion status
- Choose based on architecture consistency and simplicity

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 12-14 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Weeks 1-4: Specification work** (gap resolution, document updates, reviews)
  - Week 1: SPEC018 review/approval, error handling strategy
  - Week 2: Performance targets, SPEC014 update
  - Week 3: Queue persistence, buffer strategy
  - Week 4: Terminology, resampler, cross-document review
- **Weeks 5-14: Implementation** (8-10 weeks per GUIDE001, but with lower rework risk)

**Rework Risk:** Minimal (+5-10% contingency for minor adjustments)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

**Implementation Risks (LOW):**
- Complete specifications reduce implementation uncertainty
- Error handling strategy prevents ad-hoc decisions
- Performance targets enable early validation
- SPEC018 approval eliminates critical blocker

**Specification Quality Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Error handling strategy may not cover all scenarios
  - **Mitigation:** Research industry best practices, iterate on strategy
- **Risk:** Performance targets may be too aggressive or too conservative
  - **Mitigation:** Research Pi Zero 2W capabilities, consult existing benchmarks
- **Risk:** SPEC018 approved solution may prove incorrect during implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Design solution to be refactorable if needed

**Schedule Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Specification work takes longer than 4 weeks
  - **Impact:** Delays implementation start
  - **Mitigation:** Time-box specification work, defer low-priority gaps if needed
- **Risk:** Specification updates reveal additional gaps
  - **Impact:** Extends timeline
  - **Mitigation:** Systematic gap analysis upfront, minimize surprises

**Residual Risks (LOW):**
- Unknown unknowns always exist
- Some implementation details better discovered through coding
- But comprehensive specifications minimize these risks significantly

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Fully designed upfront
- Error handling architecture consistent and comprehensive
- Performance architecture designed for Pi Zero 2W constraints
- Queue persistence architecture ensures state consistency
- All architectural decisions intentional and documented

**Peripheral Architecture:** Also designed upfront
- Buffer management strategy specified
- Resampler state management specified
- Terminology consistent across all components

**Risk of Architectural Inconsistency:** LOW - all decisions made coherently

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: EXCELLENT**

**CLAUDE.md Mandate:**
> "MUST run `/plan [specification_document]` before implementing"

- Approach 2 aligns perfectly with /plan workflow intent
- Specification completion before implementation is exactly what /plan prescribes

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy (GOV001)
- Updates SPEC documents properly
- Maintains requirement traceability
- Creates REV### document to record changes

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems with existing implementation"
- Approach 2 prevents repeating prior specification gap mistakes
- Systematic gap resolution ensures higher quality re-write

### When to Use This Approach

**Highly Appropriate If:**
- Prior implementation failed due to specification gaps (likely given user's context)
- Production-quality implementation required
- Risk tolerance is low (prefer predictability over speed)
- Project values specification discipline
- Decision authority available for specification approvals
- Timeline can accommodate 12-14 weeks

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Extreme timeline pressure (<12 weeks to delivery)
- Specification decision authority unavailable
- Prototype/experimental implementation sufficient
- Prior implementation problems were not specification-related

---

## APPROACH 3: Hybrid - Phased Specification + Implementation

### Description

Address critical specification gaps immediately (SPEC018, error handling strategy, performance targets), then implement incrementally while refining remaining specifications in parallel.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Critical Specification Work (Weeks 1-2)**

**Week 1: Resolve Blockers**
1. **SPEC018 Formal Review**
   - Review crossfade completion signaling solution
   - Approve or revise
   - Update document status
   - **Goal:** Unblock queue advancement implementation

2. **Error Handling Strategy (High-Level)**
   - Define error taxonomy (fatal/recoverable/degraded)
   - Specify error event emissions
   - Specify user notification triggers
   - **Defer:** Detailed per-error handling logic (refine during implementation)

**Week 2: Performance and Contradiction**
3. **Performance Targets (Baseline)**
   - Define quantified targets for decode latency, CPU, memory
   - **Goal:** Enable early performance testing on Pi Zero 2W
   - **Defer:** Detailed performance test specifications (develop during testing)

4. **SPEC014 Resolution**
   - Add prominent notice that SPEC016 supersedes decoder design
   - Or move parallel decoder content to archive
   - **Goal:** Eliminate implementer confusion

**Phase 2: Core Audio Pipeline Implementation (Weeks 3-6)**

Implement using completed specifications:
- Tick-based timing (SPEC017) - already well-specified
- Fade curves (SPEC002) - already well-specified
- Decoder-buffer chain (SPEC016) - mostly complete
  - Make pragmatic decisions on PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer terminology
  - Document decisions in implementation comments
- Mixer state machine with SPEC018-approved completion signaling

**Concurrent:** Begin refining queue persistence specification

**Phase 3: Queue and Persistence (Weeks 7-9)**

**Week 7: Queue Persistence Specification**
- Specify when queue persisted (eager vs lazy)
- Specify restart reconciliation logic
- Review and approve

**Weeks 8-9: Queue Implementation**
- Implement queue manager with persistence per refined spec
- Implement buffer management
  - Make pragmatic decision on full vs incremental decode (e.g., always incremental)
  - Document decision, prepare to refine if proves suboptimal

**Concurrent:** Refine error handling details based on implementation experience

**Phase 4: Error Handling and API (Weeks 10-13)**

**Week 10: Error Handling Refinement**
- Update error handling strategy based on implementation discoveries
- Add detailed per-error handling logic
- Review and approve refined strategy

**Weeks 11-13: Error Handling Implementation + API**
- Implement refined error handling
- Implement HTTP/SSE endpoints (SPEC007)
- Integrate with event system (SPEC011)

**Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Weeks 14-15)**
- Integration testing
- Performance testing on Pi Zero 2W against targets
- Refinement based on test results

### Advantages

1. **Balances Speed with Quality:** Faster than Approach 2, more rigorous than Approach 1
2. **Critical Risks Addressed Upfront:** SPEC018, error strategy, performance targets resolved early
3. **Implementation Momentum:** Coding starts after only 2 weeks, maintains developer engagement
4. **Learning from Implementation:** Non-critical specification gaps resolved based on implementation experience
5. **Flexibility:** Can adjust specification refinement based on implementation discoveries
6. **Partially Satisfies /plan Workflow:** Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent, pragmatic on details

### Disadvantages

1. **Complex Project Management:** Parallel specification and implementation tracks require coordination
2. **Risk of Specification Invalidation:** Specification updates may invalidate in-flight implementation work
3. **Requires Discipline:** Must pause implementation when specifications prove inadequate
4. **Partial /plan Compliance:** Doesn't fully satisfy CLAUDE.md mandate (implements before all gaps resolved)
5. **Potential Rework:** Deferred specification gaps may cause refactoring later
6. **Coordination Overhead:** Switching between specification and implementation modes adds overhead

### Technical Considerations

**Critical Path Items:**
- SPEC018 approval (Week 1) gates queue advancement implementation (Week 3-6)
- Error handling strategy (Week 1) gates error handling implementation (Week 10-13)
- Performance targets (Week 2) enable early Pi Zero 2W testing (Week 7+)

**Parallel Track Coordination:**
- Core audio pipeline implementation (Weeks 3-6) concurrent with queue persistence specification (Weeks 4-7)
- Queue implementation (Weeks 8-9) concurrent with error handling refinement (Weeks 7-10)
- Must avoid dependency deadlocks (implementation waiting on spec waiting on implementation)

**Pragmatic Decision Documentation:**
- PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer terminology - document assumption in code comments
- Full vs incremental decode - implement always-incremental, prepare to refactor if needed
- Resampler state management - follow rubato documentation, document edge cases

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 10-13 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Weeks 1-2: Critical specification work** (SPEC018, error strategy, performance targets, SPEC014)
- **Weeks 3-6: Core audio pipeline** (decoder, fader, mixer, timing)
- **Weeks 7-9: Queue persistence** (spec refinement + implementation)
- **Weeks 10-13: Error handling + API** (spec refinement + implementation)
- **Weeks 14-15: Testing and validation** (may extend if issues found)

**Rework Risk:** Moderate (+10-20% contingency for specification-implementation coordination issues)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Critical Risks (ADDRESSED):**
- SPEC018 resolved early (Week 1)
- Error handling strategy specified early (Week 1)
- Performance targets defined early (Week 2)

**Implementation-Specification Coordination Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Specification update invalidates in-flight implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Focus early specifications on critical path items, defer peripheral specs
- **Risk:** Implementation discovers specification inadequacy mid-stream
  - **Mitigation:** Require discipline to pause implementation and resolve specification gap
- **Risk:** Parallel tracks create confusion about current state
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation of which specs are complete vs in-progress

**Deferred Gap Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Queue persistence specification delayed until Week 7, may reveal issues
  - **Impact:** May require refactoring of core audio pipeline if persistence affects design
  - **Mitigation:** Core audio pipeline designed to be loosely coupled from persistence
- **Risk:** Full vs incremental buffer decode decision may prove wrong
  - **Impact:** Memory or latency issues on Pi Zero 2W
  - **Mitigation:** Early performance testing (Week 7+) reveals issues with time to fix

**Residual Risks (LOW-MEDIUM):**
- Some rework possible but limited to non-critical areas
- Risk lower than Approach 1, higher than Approach 2

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-designed
- Critical architectural decisions (state machine, error handling, performance) specified upfront
- Core audio pipeline architecture complete before implementation

**Peripheral Architecture:** Evolves during implementation
- Queue persistence architecture refined mid-stream
- Buffer management architecture pragmatic initially, may refine
- Risk: Early and late components may have different architectural styles

**Mitigation:** Maintain architectural consistency through:
- Regular architecture reviews
- Refactoring passes to align early and late components
- Documentation of architectural principles to guide both spec and implementation

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: MODERATE**

**CLAUDE.md /plan Workflow:**
- Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent (SPEC018, error handling, performance)
- Defers some specification work to parallel track
- Not full compliance but pragmatic balance

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy for critical specifications
- Refines specifications based on implementation experience
- Creates REV### document to record specification evolution

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems"
- Approach 3 addresses likely critical issues (SPEC018, error handling) upfront
- Defers non-critical gaps, reducing risk compared to Approach 1
- May be appropriate if timeline constraints exist but quality still valued

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Timeline constraints exist but complete specification (Approach 2) too slow
- Prior implementation problems were critical gaps (SPEC018, error handling) rather than comprehensive specification lack
- Team has discipline to pause implementation when specification inadequate
- Project management can coordinate parallel specification/implementation tracks
- Moderate risk tolerance (between Approach 1 and Approach 2)

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Team struggles with parallel workstreams
- Prior implementation problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Very low risk tolerance (prefer Approach 2)
- Very high timeline pressure (prefer Approach 1, accept risks)

---

## APPROACH 4: Specification Audit + Targeted Fixes (Minimal)

### Description

Conduct formal, systematic audit of all wkmp-ap specifications, classify gaps by severity, and address only critical/high-severity gaps before implementation.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Systematic Specification Audit (Week 1)**

**Audit Methodology:**
1. **Document Review:**
   - Review all Tier 1-4 documents relevant to wkmp-ap
   - Extract all specifications, requirements, design decisions
   - Identify ambiguities, contradictions, missing details

2. **Gap Classification:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Blocks implementation or causes incorrect behavior
     - Example: SPEC018 draft status (crossfade completion)
   - **HIGH:** Significant risk or major rework potential
     - Example: Error handling strategy unspecified
   - **MEDIUM:** Workaround possible but suboptimal
     - Example: Queue persistence timing unclear
   - **LOW:** Cosmetic or documentation-only
     - Example: Terminology inconsistencies

3. **Gap Documentation:**
   - Create structured gap inventory (spreadsheet or markdown table)
   - For each gap:
     - Description
     - Severity classification
     - Impact on implementation
     - Affected components
     - Proposed resolution

4. **Severity Criteria:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Cannot implement without resolution, or implementation will be incorrect
   - **HIGH:** Can implement with workaround, but high rework risk or production risk
   - **MEDIUM:** Can implement with pragmatic decision, low-moderate rework risk
   - **LOW:** Does not affect implementation, documentation/consistency issue only

**Audit Deliverable:** Gap inventory with severity classifications and proposed resolutions

**Phase 2: Gap Resolution (Weeks 2-3)**

**Week 2: CRITICAL Gaps**
- SPEC018 formal review and approval
- Any other critical gaps identified during audit

**Week 3: HIGH Gaps**
- Error handling strategy specification
- Performance targets definition
- SPEC014 update/archive
- Any other high-severity gaps

**Deferred: MEDIUM and LOW Gaps**
- Queue persistence strategy (implement eager persistence as pragmatic choice)
- Buffer decode strategy (implement always-incremental as pragmatic choice)
- Terminology reconciliation (document assumptions in code)
- Resampler state management (follow library documentation)

**Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 4-13)**
- Implement with critical/high gaps resolved
- Make pragmatic decisions on medium/low gaps
- Document deferred gap decisions in code comments
- Prepare to refine if deferred gaps prove important

### Advantages

1. **Focused Effort on Highest-Impact Issues:** Systematic audit ensures critical issues prioritized
2. **Avoids Over-Specification:** Low-priority details remain flexible for implementation adaptation
3. **Faster than Full Specification:** Only 1-3 weeks spec work vs 2-4 weeks for Approach 2
4. **Systematic Gap Identification:** Formal audit reduces "unknown unknowns"
5. **Documented Rationale:** Gap inventory provides traceability for deferred decisions
6. **Audit Artifact Reusable:** Gap inventory useful for future specification refinement

### Disadvantages

1. **Severity Classification Subjective:** May defer actually-important items (classification errors)
2. **Still Requires Significant Analysis:** Audit itself takes 1 week (Week 1)
3. **Deferred Gaps May Cause Problems:** Medium/low gaps may prove more important during implementation
4. **Doesn't Fully Address User's Concern:** If prior implementation had comprehensive specification problems, audit+fixes may be insufficient
5. **Partial /plan Compliance:** Addresses critical gaps but defers others

### Technical Considerations

**Audit Scope:**
- Review all documents identified in Phase 3 (REQ001, REQ002, SPEC002, SPEC007, SPEC011, SPEC013, SPEC014, SPEC016, SPEC017, SPEC018, IMPL001, IMPL002, IMPL003, EXEC001, GUIDE001)
- Approximately 15+ documents, ~10,000+ lines total
- Estimate: 1 week for thorough audit by experienced engineer

**Gap Severity Classification:**

**Predicted CRITICAL Gaps:**
- SPEC018 status unclear (crossfade completion blocker)

**Predicted HIGH Gaps:**
- Error handling strategy unspecified
- Performance targets missing
- SPEC014 vs SPEC016 contradiction

**Predicted MEDIUM Gaps:**
- Queue persistence timing unclear
- Full vs partial buffer strategy unspecified
- Queue-chain reconciliation on restart

**Predicted LOW Gaps:**
- PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer/DecoderChain terminology
- Resampler state management details (library-specific)

**Pragmatic Decisions for Deferred Gaps:**
- Queue persistence: Implement eager persistence (every operation writes to DB)
- Buffer strategy: Always incremental decode
- Terminology: Use PassageBuffer as primary, document assumptions
- Resampler: Follow rubato documentation, handle edge cases pragmatically

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 11-13 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Week 1: Systematic audit** (gap inventory with severity classifications)
- **Week 2: CRITICAL gap resolution** (SPEC018 review/approval)
- **Week 3: HIGH gap resolution** (error handling, performance targets, SPEC014)
- **Weeks 4-13: Implementation** (8-10 weeks per GUIDE001, with pragmatic decisions on MEDIUM/LOW gaps)

**Rework Risk:** Moderate (+10-20% contingency if deferred gaps prove important)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Systematic Audit Benefits (REDUCES RISK):**
- Formal gap identification reduces unknown unknowns
- Severity classification ensures critical issues addressed
- Documented gap inventory provides traceability

**Severity Classification Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Classify actually-critical gap as medium/low, defer resolution
  - **Impact:** Implementation blocked or incorrect
  - **Mitigation:** Conservative classification (when in doubt, classify higher)
- **Risk:** Classify actually-low gap as critical, waste specification effort
  - **Impact:** Delays implementation unnecessarily
  - **Mitigation:** Require clear blocker rationale for CRITICAL classification

**Deferred Gap Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Queue persistence strategy (MEDIUM) proves inadequate
  - **Impact:** State inconsistencies, refactoring required
  - **Mitigation:** Eager persistence is safe default, unlikely to be wrong
- **Risk:** Buffer decode strategy (MEDIUM) causes memory or latency issues
  - **Impact:** Performance problems on Pi Zero 2W
  - **Mitigation:** Early performance testing reveals issues with time to fix
- **Risk:** Terminology inconsistencies (LOW) cause implementer confusion
  - **Impact:** Misunderstandings, misimplementation
  - **Mitigation:** Document assumptions clearly in code comments

**Residual Risks (MEDIUM):**
- Depends heavily on quality of severity classification
- If classification is accurate, risk similar to Approach 3
- If classification is poor, risk approaches Approach 1

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-designed for critical areas
- Critical architectural decisions (crossfade completion, error handling) specified
- Performance architecture designed for constraints

**Peripheral Architecture:** Pragmatic
- Queue persistence architecture pragmatic (eager approach)
- Buffer management architecture pragmatic (incremental decode)
- May not be optimal but functional

**Risk of Architectural Inconsistency:** Medium - critical areas designed, peripheral areas pragmatic

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: MODERATE**

**CLAUDE.md /plan Workflow:**
- Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent
- Risk-based approach pragmatic for resource-constrained projects
- Audit artifact provides traceability
- Not full compliance but defensible

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy for critical specifications
- Deferred gaps documented in audit artifact
- May create REV### document to record critical gap resolutions

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems"
- Approach 4 addresses likely critical issues
- May be insufficient if prior problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Appropriate if prior problems were specific critical gaps

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Need systematic gap identification (audit valuable artifact)
- Confident in ability to classify gap severity accurately
- Prior implementation problems were specific critical gaps (not comprehensive specification lack)
- Moderate timeline pressure (11-13 weeks acceptable)
- Moderate risk tolerance

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Severity classification expertise unavailable
- Prior implementation problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Very low risk tolerance (prefer Approach 2)
- Very high timeline pressure (prefer Approach 1, accept higher risks)

## Comparison Summary

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Factor | Approach 1 | Approach 2 | Approach 3 | Approach 4 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Timeline** | 8-10 weeks | 12-14 weeks | 10-13 weeks | 11-13 weeks |
| **Risk** | Medium-High | Low-Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Specification Work** | None | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks critical | 1-3 weeks targeted |
| **Rework Risk** | +20-40% | +5-10% | +10-20% | +10-20% |
| **/plan Compliance** | Poor | Excellent | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Appropriate If** | Timeline critical | Quality critical | Balanced priorities | Need audit |

### Recommendation

**Given user's context (considering re-write due to implementation problems):**

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Approach 2 (Specification Completion)**
- **Rationale:** Prior implementation problems suggest specification gaps were significant
- **Benefit:** Prevents repeating mistakes
- **Cost:** 2-4 weeks specification work, but reduces overall rework risk significantly
- **Alignment:** Strongly aligns with CLAUDE.md /plan workflow and WKMP documentation rigor

**ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: Approach 3 (Hybrid Phased)**
- **Rationale:** If timeline constraints exist but quality still valued
- **Benefit:** Addresses critical gaps (SPEC018, error handling) early, maintains momentum
- **Cost:** More complex project management, some rework risk
- **Appropriate If:** Timeline cannot accommodate 12-14 weeks but 10-13 weeks acceptable

**NOT RECOMMENDED:**
- **Approach 1:** Risks repeating prior implementation problems
- **Approach 4:** Similar to Approach 3 but less systematic; audit overhead without full benefit

**Decision Factors:**
- If timeline > 12 weeks available: **Approach 2**
- If timeline 10-13 weeks: **Approach 3**
- If timeline < 10 weeks: **Approach 1** with acceptance of risks, or extend timeline

**User retains decision authority based on:**
- Timeline constraints
- Resource availability (specification decision authority)
- Risk tolerance
- Prior implementation problem root cause assessment
