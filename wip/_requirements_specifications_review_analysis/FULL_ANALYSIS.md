## Executive Summary (5-minute read)

### Context

User is considering a **re-write of wkmp-ap** (Audio Player module) due to problems with existing implementation and requests a review of specifications for:
- **Internal consistency** - Do specifications contradict each other?
- **Clarity** - Are specifications clear and unambiguous?
- **Completeness** - Are there gaps preventing implementation?
- **Implementation readiness** - Can wkmp-ap be implemented from current specifications?

### Overall Assessment

**Specification Quality: GOOD with CRITICAL GAPS**

WKMP documentation demonstrates exceptional rigor compared to typical projects:
- ✅ Well-defined 5-tier document hierarchy (GOV001)
- ✅ Formal requirement traceability (GOV002)
- ✅ Precise mathematical specifications (tick-based timing, fade curves)
- ✅ Comprehensive entity model aligned with MusicBrainz
- ✅ Detailed database schema with triggers and constraints

**However, wkmp-ap specifications contain critical gaps that would block correct implementation:**

❌ **BLOCKER:** SPEC018 (Crossfade Completion Coordination) has "Draft" status - identifies critical gap in mixer-to-engine communication but unclear if solution is approved/implemented

❌ **HIGH RISK:** No error handling strategy specified (decode failures, buffer underruns, device failures)

❌ **CONTRADICTION:** SPEC014 describes outdated parallel decoder design; SPEC016 specifies serial decode

### Critical Findings (1-minute read)

1. **SPEC018 Status Unclear (BLOCKER)** - Draft specification identifies critical crossfade coordination gap; implementation cannot proceed without resolution

2. **Error Handling Missing (HIGH RISK)** - No specifications for decode failures, buffer underruns, audio device failures, queue inconsistencies

3. **SPEC014 vs SPEC016 Contradiction** - SPEC014 (parallel 2-thread pool) contradicts SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040] (serial decode)

4. **Performance Targets Missing** - No quantified CPU, latency, memory, or throughput specs despite Pi Zero 2W deployment target

5. **✅ Core Audio Architecture Excellent** - Tick-based timing (SPEC017), fade curves (SPEC002), crossfade model are precise and ready for implementation

6. **✅ Entity Model Clear** - Passage, Song, Recording, Work, Artist relationships (REQ002) well-defined and aligned with MusicBrainz

7. **Queue Persistence Unclear** - When/how is queue state persisted? How is runtime chain assignment reconciled with database on restart?

8. **Full vs Partial Buffer Strategy** - SPEC016 mentions but doesn't specify decision logic

9. **Terminology Inconsistencies** - PassageBuffer vs ManagedBuffer vs DecoderChain naming not fully reconciled (low impact)

10. **Database Schema Comprehensive** - IMPL001 thoroughly specifies all tables, columns, constraints, triggers (ready for implementation)

### Recommendation

**Given context (re-write consideration due to prior implementation problems), recommend:**

**PRIMARY: Approach 2 (Specification Completion Before Implementation)**
- Systematically address identified gaps before coding begins
- Prevents repeating prior mistakes
- Adds 2-4 weeks to timeline but reduces rework risk significantly
- Aligns with CLAUDE.md /plan workflow mandate for >5 requirements

**ALTERNATIVE: Approach 3 (Hybrid - Phased Specification + Implementation)**
- If timeline constraints exist, address critical gaps (SPEC018, error handling) immediately
- Implement core audio pipeline while refining peripheral specifications in parallel
- Balances speed with quality
- Requires strong project management to coordinate parallel tracks

**NOT RECOMMENDED:**
- **Approach 1 (Accept Gaps)** - Risks repeating prior implementation problems
- **Approach 4 (Audit + Fixes)** - Similar to Approach 3 but less systematic

### Decisions Required

1. **Which implementation approach?** (Select from 4 analyzed approaches)
2. **Is SPEC018 solution approved?** (Must resolve before implementing queue advancement)
3. **What error handling strategy?** (If adopting Approach 2, 3, or 4 - must specify comprehensively)
4. **What performance targets?** (Define decode latency, CPU %, memory limits for Pi Zero 2W)
5. **Update or archive SPEC014?** (Resolve outdated parallel decoder pool content)

---

### ⚠️ PARTIAL SPECIFICATIONS (Missing Details)

#### 6. Decoder-Buffer Chain Lifecycle (SPEC016)
**Readiness:** GOOD - Lifecycle clear, some terminology fuzzy

**Well-Specified:**
- Chain assignment triggers [DBD-LIFECYCLE-010]
- Chain release conditions [DBD-LIFECYCLE-020]
- Chain allocation strategy (min-heap) [DBD-LIFECYCLE-030]
- HashMap tracking [DBD-LIFECYCLE-040]

**Gaps:**
- Relationship between `PassageBuffer`, `ManagedBuffer`, `DecoderChain` unclear
- SPEC016 line 112: "PassageBuffer wrapped in ManagedBuffer" but ManagedBuffer not defined
- Are these three separate types or aliases?
- Which type is used at which layer?

**Impact:** LOW - Naming conventions, likely resolvable from implementation context

**Workaround:** Assume PassageBuffer is core data structure, ManagedBuffer adds lifecycle, DecoderChain integrates pipeline

---

#### 7. Queue Persistence Strategy (IMPL001, SPEC016) ✅ RESOLVED (2025-10-25)
**Readiness:** ✅ COMPLETE - Persistence timing and reconciliation logic now specified

**Well-Specified:**
- Queue table structure [IMPL001]
- play_order column for queue sequencing
- Runtime chain assignment HashMap [DBD-LIFECYCLE-040]
- **NEW:** Eager persistence on enqueue [SPEC007 API-QUEUE-PERSIST-010]

- ✅ How is state reconciled on restart? **ANSWERED:** 5-step restoration with validation (see [DBD-STARTUP-010](../../docs/SPEC016-decoder_buffer_design.md#L112-L124))
- ✅ What if queue diverges/corrupts? **ANSWERED:** Clear queue entirely, log error, continue with empty queue

**Impact:** ✅ RESOLVED - Restart behavior and state consistency fully specified

**Implementation:** Follow [SPEC007 API-QUEUE-PERSIST-010] for persistence, [SPEC016 DBD-STARTUP-010] for restoration

---

#### 8. Full vs Partial Buffer Strategy (SPEC016, SPEC014)
**Readiness:** FAIR - Buffer size specified, decode strategy unclear

**Well-Specified:**
- playout_ringbuffer_size = 661941 samples (15.01s @ 44.1kHz) [DBD-PARAM-070]
- Per-buffer memory: ~5.3 MB
- Total memory for 12 buffers: ~60 MB

**Gaps:**
- SPEC014 line 62 mentions "Full/partial buffer strategy"
- When to fully decode passage into buffer vs incremental decode?
- Decision criteria not specified:
  - Always full buffer for passages <15s?
  - Incremental decode for long passages?
  - Based on queue depth (immediate playback vs prefetch)?
- Incremental decode resumption logic not specified

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects memory efficiency and startup latency

**Workaround:** Implement incremental decode for all passages (pause when buffer full, resume when space available)

---

#### 9. Resampler State Management (SPEC016)
**Readiness:** FAIR - Resampling behavior specified, state details unclear

**Well-Specified:**
- Use rubato StatefulResampler [DBD-RSMP-010]
- Bypass when source_rate == working_sample_rate [DBD-RSMP-020]
- Integrate into decoder chain [DBD-RSMP-030]

**Gaps:**
- State initialization details (rubato-specific)
- Flush behavior when stream ends (prevent buffer tail loss)
- Edge case: What if sample rate changes mid-file? (unlikely but possible)

**Impact:** LOW - Implementation details likely inferrable from rubato library documentation

**Workaround:** Consult rubato documentation for StatefulResampler usage patterns

---

### ❌ CRITICAL GAPS (Implementation Blockers)

#### 10. SPEC018 Status and Approval (BLOCKER)
**Readiness:** UNKNOWN - Draft status concerning

**Problem Identified:**
- SPEC018 identifies critical gap: Mixer completes crossfade internally but engine never notified
- Consequence: Queue advancement stops/restarts incoming passage incorrectly
- SPEC018 proposes solution (mixer-to-engine completion signaling)

**Gaps:**
- Document status: "Draft → Implementation" (line 6)
- Is this solution approved?
- Is it already implemented in current codebase?
- If not implemented, which specific approach should be used?

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Incorrect queue advancement is a **blocking bug**

**Blocker Rationale:**
- Cannot implement queue processing logic without knowing crossfade completion signaling design
- Guessing at solution may conflict with unstated design intent
- Re-work risk: HIGH if wrong approach implemented

**Required Resolution:**
1. Clarify SPEC018 status: Draft or Approved?
2. If Draft: Conduct formal review and approval
3. If Approved: Update status in document
4. If already implemented: Document actual implementation approach

---

#### 11. Error Handling Strategy (HIGH RISK)
**Readiness:** NONE - Completely unspecified

**Scenarios Requiring Error Handling:**
1. **Decode Failures:**
   - File corrupted or unreadable
   - Unsupported codec variant
   - Partial decode (file truncated)
   - **Action:** Skip passage? Retry? User notification? Event emission?

2. **Buffer Underruns:**
   - Decoder too slow to keep buffer filled
   - CPU overload or I/O stall
   - **Action:** Pause playback? Insert silence? Emergency buffer refill?

3. **Audio Device Failures:**
   - Device disconnected (Bluetooth, HDMI)
   - Device becomes unavailable (another app takes exclusive access)
   - **Action:** Pause? Reconnect? Fallback to different device? User alert?

4. **Queue Inconsistencies:**
   - Passage referenced in queue but not in database
   - File path invalid (file moved/deleted)
   - Chain assignment impossible (all chains busy, queue > maximum_decode_streams)
   - **Action:** Remove from queue? Skip? User notification?

5. **Sample Rate Conversion Errors:**
   - Rubato resampler failure
   - Invalid sample rate from decoder
   - **Action:** Bypass resampling? Skip passage? Log and continue?

**Impact:** HIGH RISK - Production system requires comprehensive error handling

**Gaps:**
- No specifications for:
  - Error detection mechanisms
  - Error recovery strategies
  - User notification patterns
  - Event emission for error conditions
  - Graceful degradation behavior
  - Logging/telemetry requirements

**Blocker Rationale:**
- Ad-hoc error handling leads to inconsistent behavior
- Missing errors cause crashes or silent failures
- No testing possible without error scenarios specified

**Required Specification:**
- Error taxonomy (categorize by severity and recoverability)
- Per-category handling strategies
- Event definitions for error conditions
- User notification triggers
- Logging requirements
- Graceful degradation behaviors

---

#### 12. Performance Targets (Cannot Validate Success)
**Readiness:** NONE - No quantified specifications

**Context:**
- WKMP targets Raspberry Pi Zero 2W deployment [SPEC014 SSD-DEC-030]
- Pi Zero 2W: 1 GHz quad-core ARMv8, 512 MB RAM
- Limited CPU and memory compared to desktop

**Missing Specifications:**
1. **Decode Latency:**
   - What is acceptable buffer fill time?
   - Target: Buffer fills in <500ms? <1s? <2s?
   - Maximum tolerable latency before playback starts?

2. **CPU Usage:**
   - Maximum acceptable CPU percentage?
   - Target: <50% average? <80% peak?
   - Per-core or aggregate?

3. **Memory Limits:**
   - Maximum total memory usage?
   - SPEC016 calculates 60 MB for 12 buffers, but is that total app memory?
   - Target: Total app <100 MB? <200 MB?

4. **Throughput:**
   - How many passages can be decoded per minute?
   - Queue refill rate requirement?

5. **Response Time:**
   - API endpoint response time targets?
   - Skip command latency requirement?
   - UI update delay tolerance?

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Cannot validate implementation success without targets

**Gaps:**
- No quantified acceptance criteria
- Cannot perform performance testing without benchmarks
- Cannot detect regressions
- Cannot validate Pi Zero 2W suitability

**Workaround:** Implement without targets, then measure empirically on Pi Zero 2W and set targets based on observed performance

---

#### 13. SPEC014 vs SPEC016 Contradiction
**Readiness:** CONFLICTING - Outdated content may mislead implementers

**Contradiction:**
- **SPEC014 lines 26-106:** Describes parallel 2-thread decoder pool
  - "Fixed pool: 2 decoder threads"
  - "Rationale: Sufficient for current + next passage full decode"
  - Thread creation, priority queue management specified
- **SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040]:** Specifies serial decode execution
  - "one decoder at a time"
  - "serial decoding approach for improved cache coherency"

**Clarification in SPEC014:**
- Line 76 note: "Design evolved to serial decode execution (SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040])"
- Line 78 note: "This section describes the original 2-thread pool design"

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Misleading if implementer reads SPEC014 first without seeing notes

**Problem:**
- SPEC014 contains detailed design for approach that is no longer used
- Implementer may waste time implementing 2-thread pool before discovering it's obsolete
- SPEC016 is authoritative per note, but SPEC014 not updated to match

**Required Resolution:**
1. **Option A:** Update SPEC014 to describe serial decode design matching SPEC016
2. **Option B:** Move SPEC014 parallel decode content to archive and add forward reference to SPEC016
3. **Option C:** Add prominent notice at top of SPEC014 that SPEC016 supersedes decoder design sections

### Overall Assessment

**Can wkmp-ap be implemented from current specifications?**

**ANSWER: PARTIALLY**

- **60% of implementation** can proceed with high confidence (core audio algorithms, database, entity model)
- **30% of implementation** can proceed with workarounds (chain lifecycle, queue persistence, buffer strategy)
- **10% of implementation** is **blocked or high-risk** (crossfade completion, error handling, performance validation)

**For production-quality implementation:** Must resolve critical gaps before coding begins.

**For prototype/experimental implementation:** Could proceed with core audio pipeline, defer error handling and performance optimization.

# Implementation Approach Comparison

**Section:** Detailed Comparison of 4 Implementation Approaches
**Parent Document:** [00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](00_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md)

---

## Purpose

This document provides detailed comparison of 4 possible approaches for proceeding with wkmp-ap implementation given the current specification state.

**Context:** User is considering re-write of wkmp-ap due to problems with existing implementation, suggesting prior implementation may have suffered from specification gaps.

---

## Approach Overview

| Approach | Timeline | Risk | Specification Work | Implementation Start |
|----------|----------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Accept Gaps | 8-10 weeks | Medium-High | None | Immediate |
| 2. Full Specification | 12-14 weeks | Low-Medium | 2-4 weeks | After spec work |
| 3. Hybrid Phased | 10-13 weeks | Medium | 1-2 weeks critical | After critical specs |
| 4. Audit + Fixes | 11-13 weeks | Medium | 1-3 weeks targeted | After gap audit |

---

## APPROACH 1: Implement with Current Specifications (Accept Gaps)

### Description

Proceed with implementation using existing specifications as-is, making pragmatic implementation decisions where specifications are incomplete or ambiguous.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Audio Pipeline (Weeks 1-4)**
- Implement tick-based timing system (SPEC017) - well-specified
- Implement fade curve algorithms (SPEC002) - well-specified
- Implement decoder-buffer chain (SPEC016) - mostly well-specified
  - **Gap Decision:** Use PassageBuffer as core data structure, wrap in lifecycle manager
- Implement mixer state machine (SPEC018)
  - **Gap Decision:** Guess at crossfade completion signaling approach (e.g., mixer returns completion event on each mix() call)

**Phase 2: Queue and Persistence (Weeks 4-6)**
- Implement queue manager (IMPL001 schema)
  - **Gap Decision:** Persist queue eagerly (every enqueue/dequeue operation writes to database)
  - **Gap Decision:** On startup, restore queue from database and rebuild chain assignments
- Implement buffer management
  - **Gap Decision:** Always use incremental decode (pause when buffer full, resume when space available)

**Phase 3: Error Handling (Weeks 6-7)**
- Implement ad-hoc error handling following Rust best practices
  - **Gap Decision:** Decode errors → skip passage + emit error event + log warning
  - **Gap Decision:** Buffer underruns → pause playback + log error + attempt refill
  - **Gap Decision:** Device failures → pause playback + emit error event + await reconnection
  - **Gap Decision:** Queue inconsistencies → remove invalid entry + log error + continue

**Phase 4: API and Integration (Weeks 7-10)**
- Implement HTTP/SSE endpoints (SPEC007)
- Integrate with event system (SPEC011)
- End-to-end testing
  - **Gap:** No performance targets - test on Pi Zero 2W empirically and note observed performance

### Advantages

1. **Fastest Time-to-Implementation:** 8-10 weeks (no specification work delays)
2. **Avoids Analysis Paralysis:** Prevents over-specification of details that may prove wrong during implementation
3. **Leverages Existing Specifications:** Substantial work already done (tick system, crossfades, entity model)
4. **Real Implementation Experience:** Reveals true specification gaps through actual coding
5. **Many Gaps Are Implementation Details:** Terminology, buffer strategy, resampler state management don't affect core architecture

### Disadvantages

1. **Architectural Mismatch Risk:** Gap-filling decisions may conflict with unstated design intent (e.g., SPEC018 crossfade completion signaling)
2. **SPEC018 Critical Uncertainty:** Draft status creates risk of implementing incorrect queue advancement logic
3. **Error Handling Strategy Undefined:** Ad-hoc approach may not match project's error handling conventions or user expectations
4. **Rework Likely:** If gap-filling decisions contradict future specification updates, significant refactoring required
5. **Performance Validation Impossible:** No targets means cannot determine if implementation succeeds on Pi Zero 2W
6. **Contradicts /plan Workflow:** CLAUDE.md mandates `/plan` for >5 requirements; wkmp-ap has dozens of requirements

### Technical Considerations

**Well-Specified Areas (Immediate Implementation):**
- Tick-based timing (SPEC017) - complete formulas
- Fade curves (SPEC002) - mathematical definitions
- Crossfade timing model (SPEC002) - 6-point constraints
- Entity model (REQ002) - Rust structs derivable
- Database schema (IMPL001) - CREATE TABLE statements ready

**Gap-Filling Required:**
- SPEC018 crossfade completion - **HIGH RISK** guess
- Error handling - follows Rust/Tokio patterns but may mismatch project expectations
- Queue persistence timing - eager approach reasonable but not specified
- Buffer strategy - incremental decode sensible but not specified
- Performance - empirical measurement on Pi Zero 2W after implementation

**SPEC014 Contradiction:**
- Implement serial decode per SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040]
- Ignore SPEC014 parallel decoder pool sections (outdated)

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 8-10 weeks** (per GUIDE001 baseline)

Breakdown:
- Weeks 1-4: Core audio pipeline (decoder, fader, mixer, timing)
- Weeks 4-6: Queue manager, persistence, buffer management
- Weeks 6-7: Ad-hoc error handling
- Weeks 7-10: API endpoints, SSE, integration testing

**Rework Risk:** +20-40% additional time if gap-filling decisions prove incorrect

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Critical Risks:**
1. **SPEC018 Draft Status (CRITICAL):**
   - Risk: Implement wrong crossfade completion signaling approach
   - Impact: Queue advancement bugs, incorrect playback sequence
   - Mitigation: Review SPEC018 carefully, implement simplest solution, prepare for refactor

2. **Error Handling Mismatch (HIGH):**
   - Risk: Ad-hoc error handling doesn't match project conventions
   - Impact: Inconsistent error behavior, poor user experience
   - Mitigation: Follow Rust best practices, emit events for all errors, log comprehensively

3. **Performance Failure on Pi Zero 2W (MEDIUM):**
   - Risk: Implementation too CPU/memory intensive for target hardware
   - Impact: Cannot deploy on intended platform
   - Mitigation: Early testing on Pi Zero 2W, profile and optimize as needed

4. **Specification Contradiction Discovery (MEDIUM):**
   - Risk: Later discover SPEC014/SPEC016 contradictions affect more than just decoder
   - Impact: Confusion, misimplementation
   - Mitigation: Treat SPEC016 as authoritative for all decoder-buffer-mixer design

**Residual Risks:**
- Unknown unknowns from unspecified areas
- Potential for cascading rework if core assumptions prove wrong

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-preserved
- Single-stream playback with tick-based timing per SPEC013/SPEC016/SPEC017
- Crossfade timing model per SPEC002
- Entity model per REQ002

**Peripheral Architecture:** Ad-hoc
- Error handling strategy emerges from implementation
- Performance characteristics discovered empirically
- Queue persistence strategy pragmatic but not designed

**Risk of Inconsistency:** Medium - core is solid, peripherals may not integrate cleanly

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: POOR**

**CLAUDE.md Mandate:**
> "For all features requiring >5 requirements OR novel/complex features:
> - MUST run `/plan [specification_document]` before implementing"

- wkmp-ap has dozens of requirements across REQ001, REQ002, multiple SPEC documents
- wkmp-ap is novel/complex (sample-accurate crossfading, tick-based timing)
- Approach 1 violates `/plan` workflow mandate

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems with existing implementation"
- Suggests prior implementation suffered from specification gaps
- Approach 1 risks repeating prior mistakes

**Documentation Framework:**
- WKMP has rigorous 5-tier hierarchy (GOV001)
- Project values specification-driven development
- Approach 1 undermines specification discipline

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Timeline is extremely constrained (must ship in 8-10 weeks)
- Prior implementation problems were not specification-related
- Decision authority accepts gap-filling risk
- Prototype/experimental implementation (not production)

**Not Appropriate If:**
- Prior implementation failed due to specification gaps (likely given user's context)
- Production-quality implementation required
- Risk tolerance is low
- Project adherence to /plan workflow valued

## APPROACH 2: Specification Completion Before Implementation

### Description

Systematically address all identified gaps and ambiguities in specifications before implementation begins. Update SPEC documents to provide complete, unambiguous implementation guidance.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Specification Gap Resolution (Weeks 1-4)**

**Week 1: Critical Gaps**
1. **SPEC018 Formal Review and Approval**
   - Conduct detailed review of SPEC018 crossfade completion solution
   - Evaluate proposed signaling mechanism
   - Approve or revise specification
   - Update document status to "Approved"
   - If revisions needed, iterate until approved

2. **Error Handling Strategy Specification**
   - Create comprehensive error taxonomy:
     - Decode errors (file corrupted, unsupported codec, partial decode)
     - Buffer errors (underrun, allocation failure)
     - Device errors (disconnected, unavailable, configuration failure)
     - Queue errors (invalid passage, file not found, chain exhaustion)
     - Resampling errors (conversion failure, invalid rate)
   - Define per-category handling strategies:
     - Fatal (halt playback, require user intervention)
     - Recoverable (retry, skip, fallback)
     - Degraded (log, continue with reduced functionality)
   - Specify event emissions for each error type
   - Define user notification triggers
   - Specify logging requirements
   - Define graceful degradation behaviors

**Week 2: High-Priority Gaps**
3. **Performance Target Specification**
   - Research Pi Zero 2W capabilities (CPU, memory, I/O)
   - Define quantified targets:
     - Decode latency: Buffer fills in <1s for 15s buffer
     - CPU usage: <60% average, <85% peak (single core)
     - Memory limit: Total app <150 MB
     - API response time: <50ms for control endpoints
     - Skip command latency: <100ms
   - Create performance test specifications
   - Define measurement methodologies

4. **SPEC014 Update or Archive**
   - **Option A:** Rewrite SPEC014 decoder sections to match SPEC016 serial decode
   - **Option B:** Move parallel decoder content to archive, add forward reference to SPEC016
   - Eliminate contradiction between SPEC014 and SPEC016

**Week 3: Medium-Priority Gaps**
5. **Queue Persistence Strategy**
   - Specify when queue is persisted:
     - Eager persistence: Every enqueue/dequeue operation writes to database
     - Lazy persistence: Periodic writes (every 5 seconds)
     - Shutdown persistence: Only on graceful shutdown
   - Specify restart reconciliation logic:
     - Load queue from database
     - Rebuild chain assignments based on queue position
     - Validate passage and file existence
     - Remove invalid entries
   - Specify consistency guarantees (eventual consistency acceptable?)

6. **Buffer Decode Strategy**
   - Specify full vs incremental decode decision logic:
     - Option A: Always incremental (pause when buffer full, resume when space available)
     - Option B: Full decode for passages <15s, incremental for longer
     - Option C: Based on queue depth (full for immediate playback, incremental for prefetch)
   - Specify resumption behavior
   - Specify buffer fill prioritization (currently playing > next > prefetch)

**Week 4: Low-Priority Gaps + Documentation**
7. **Terminology Reconciliation**
   - Clarify PassageBuffer vs ManagedBuffer vs DecoderChain
   - Update SPEC016 to define all three types and their relationships
   - Ensure consistent usage across all documents

8. **Resampler State Management**
   - Specify StatefulResampler initialization
   - Specify flush behavior (prevent buffer tail loss)
   - Specify edge case handling (sample rate change mid-file)

9. **Cross-Document Review**
   - Verify all SPEC documents consistent after updates
   - Update cross-references as needed
   - Ensure REQ traceability preserved

**Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 5-14)**
- Follow GUIDE001 phased implementation plan
- Implement with complete specifications (no gap-filling required)
- Unit tests for all components (specs provide test cases)
- Integration tests based on acceptance criteria
- Performance validation against specified targets

### Advantages

1. **Reduced Rework Risk:** Decisions made upfront with full context, minimal refactoring needed
2. **Comprehensive Error Strategy:** Error handling designed proactively, consistent behavior
3. **Performance Targets Defined:** Measurable success criteria, validation possible
4. **SPEC018 Status Resolved:** Critical crossfade coordination clarified and approved
5. **Documentation Updated:** SPEC014 contradiction eliminated, terminology consistent
6. **Aligns with /plan Workflow:** Satisfies CLAUDE.md mandate for complex features
7. **Testability:** Complete specs enable comprehensive test suite design
8. **Confidence:** Implementation proceeds with high certainty, low anxiety about unknowns

### Disadvantages

1. **Slower Time-to-Implementation:** 12-14 weeks total (2-4 weeks spec work + 8-10 weeks coding)
2. **Risk of Over-Specification:** Some details may be better discovered through implementation
3. **Requires Decision Authority:** Specification updates need approval from project stakeholders
4. **May Reveal More Gaps:** Systematic gap analysis may uncover additional issues requiring specification
5. **Specification Quality Risk:** Incorrect decisions made during spec work could be worse than pragmatic implementation decisions

### Technical Considerations

**Specification Updates:**
- Follow GOV001 document hierarchy (update Tier 2 SPEC, Tier 3 IMPL as needed)
- Maintain requirement traceability (GOV002 enumeration)
- Create REV### document to record specification changes

**Error Handling Research:**
- Research industry best practices (how do other audio players handle errors?)
- Review Rust/Tokio error handling patterns
- Consider user experience (what should user see when errors occur?)

**Performance Research:**
- Profile existing audio applications on Pi Zero 2W
- Understand Pi Zero 2W I/O characteristics (SD card, USB, network)
- Research symphonia/rubato performance characteristics

**SPEC018 Decision:**
- Review mixer state machine (None/SinglePassage/Crossfading)
- Evaluate completion signaling options:
  - Option A: Mixer returns completion event on each mix() call
  - Option B: Mixer emits completion via event bus
  - Option C: Engine polls mixer for completion status
- Choose based on architecture consistency and simplicity

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 12-14 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Weeks 1-4: Specification work** (gap resolution, document updates, reviews)
  - Week 1: SPEC018 review/approval, error handling strategy
  - Week 2: Performance targets, SPEC014 update
  - Week 3: Queue persistence, buffer strategy
  - Week 4: Terminology, resampler, cross-document review
- **Weeks 5-14: Implementation** (8-10 weeks per GUIDE001, but with lower rework risk)

**Rework Risk:** Minimal (+5-10% contingency for minor adjustments)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

**Implementation Risks (LOW):**
- Complete specifications reduce implementation uncertainty
- Error handling strategy prevents ad-hoc decisions
- Performance targets enable early validation
- SPEC018 approval eliminates critical blocker

**Specification Quality Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Error handling strategy may not cover all scenarios
  - **Mitigation:** Research industry best practices, iterate on strategy
- **Risk:** Performance targets may be too aggressive or too conservative
  - **Mitigation:** Research Pi Zero 2W capabilities, consult existing benchmarks
- **Risk:** SPEC018 approved solution may prove incorrect during implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Design solution to be refactorable if needed

**Schedule Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Specification work takes longer than 4 weeks
  - **Impact:** Delays implementation start
  - **Mitigation:** Time-box specification work, defer low-priority gaps if needed
- **Risk:** Specification updates reveal additional gaps
  - **Impact:** Extends timeline
  - **Mitigation:** Systematic gap analysis upfront, minimize surprises

**Residual Risks (LOW):**
- Unknown unknowns always exist
- Some implementation details better discovered through coding
- But comprehensive specifications minimize these risks significantly

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Fully designed upfront
- Error handling architecture consistent and comprehensive
- Performance architecture designed for Pi Zero 2W constraints
- Queue persistence architecture ensures state consistency
- All architectural decisions intentional and documented

**Peripheral Architecture:** Also designed upfront
- Buffer management strategy specified
- Resampler state management specified
- Terminology consistent across all components

**Risk of Architectural Inconsistency:** LOW - all decisions made coherently

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: EXCELLENT**

**CLAUDE.md Mandate:**
> "MUST run `/plan [specification_document]` before implementing"

- Approach 2 aligns perfectly with /plan workflow intent
- Specification completion before implementation is exactly what /plan prescribes

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy (GOV001)
- Updates SPEC documents properly
- Maintains requirement traceability
- Creates REV### document to record changes

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems with existing implementation"
- Approach 2 prevents repeating prior specification gap mistakes
- Systematic gap resolution ensures higher quality re-write

### When to Use This Approach

**Highly Appropriate If:**
- Prior implementation failed due to specification gaps (likely given user's context)
- Production-quality implementation required
- Risk tolerance is low (prefer predictability over speed)
- Project values specification discipline
- Decision authority available for specification approvals
- Timeline can accommodate 12-14 weeks

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Extreme timeline pressure (<12 weeks to delivery)
- Specification decision authority unavailable
- Prototype/experimental implementation sufficient
- Prior implementation problems were not specification-related

---

## APPROACH 3: Hybrid - Phased Specification + Implementation

### Description

Address critical specification gaps immediately (SPEC018, error handling strategy, performance targets), then implement incrementally while refining remaining specifications in parallel.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Critical Specification Work (Weeks 1-2)**

**Week 1: Resolve Blockers**
1. **SPEC018 Formal Review**
   - Review crossfade completion signaling solution
   - Approve or revise
   - Update document status
   - **Goal:** Unblock queue advancement implementation

2. **Error Handling Strategy (High-Level)**
   - Define error taxonomy (fatal/recoverable/degraded)
   - Specify error event emissions
   - Specify user notification triggers
   - **Defer:** Detailed per-error handling logic (refine during implementation)

**Week 2: Performance and Contradiction**
3. **Performance Targets (Baseline)**
   - Define quantified targets for decode latency, CPU, memory
   - **Goal:** Enable early performance testing on Pi Zero 2W
   - **Defer:** Detailed performance test specifications (develop during testing)

4. **SPEC014 Resolution**
   - Add prominent notice that SPEC016 supersedes decoder design
   - Or move parallel decoder content to archive
   - **Goal:** Eliminate implementer confusion

**Phase 2: Core Audio Pipeline Implementation (Weeks 3-6)**

Implement using completed specifications:
- Tick-based timing (SPEC017) - already well-specified
- Fade curves (SPEC002) - already well-specified
- Decoder-buffer chain (SPEC016) - mostly complete
  - Make pragmatic decisions on PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer terminology
  - Document decisions in implementation comments
- Mixer state machine with SPEC018-approved completion signaling

**Concurrent:** Begin refining queue persistence specification

**Phase 3: Queue and Persistence (Weeks 7-9)**

**Week 7: Queue Persistence Specification**
- Specify when queue persisted (eager vs lazy)
- Specify restart reconciliation logic
- Review and approve

**Weeks 8-9: Queue Implementation**
- Implement queue manager with persistence per refined spec
- Implement buffer management
  - Make pragmatic decision on full vs incremental decode (e.g., always incremental)
  - Document decision, prepare to refine if proves suboptimal

**Concurrent:** Refine error handling details based on implementation experience

**Phase 4: Error Handling and API (Weeks 10-13)**

**Week 10: Error Handling Refinement**
- Update error handling strategy based on implementation discoveries
- Add detailed per-error handling logic
- Review and approve refined strategy

**Weeks 11-13: Error Handling Implementation + API**
- Implement refined error handling
- Implement HTTP/SSE endpoints (SPEC007)
- Integrate with event system (SPEC011)

**Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Weeks 14-15)**
- Integration testing
- Performance testing on Pi Zero 2W against targets
- Refinement based on test results

### Advantages

1. **Balances Speed with Quality:** Faster than Approach 2, more rigorous than Approach 1
2. **Critical Risks Addressed Upfront:** SPEC018, error strategy, performance targets resolved early
3. **Implementation Momentum:** Coding starts after only 2 weeks, maintains developer engagement
4. **Learning from Implementation:** Non-critical specification gaps resolved based on implementation experience
5. **Flexibility:** Can adjust specification refinement based on implementation discoveries
6. **Partially Satisfies /plan Workflow:** Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent, pragmatic on details

### Disadvantages

1. **Complex Project Management:** Parallel specification and implementation tracks require coordination
2. **Risk of Specification Invalidation:** Specification updates may invalidate in-flight implementation work
3. **Requires Discipline:** Must pause implementation when specifications prove inadequate
4. **Partial /plan Compliance:** Doesn't fully satisfy CLAUDE.md mandate (implements before all gaps resolved)
5. **Potential Rework:** Deferred specification gaps may cause refactoring later
6. **Coordination Overhead:** Switching between specification and implementation modes adds overhead

### Technical Considerations

**Critical Path Items:**
- SPEC018 approval (Week 1) gates queue advancement implementation (Week 3-6)
- Error handling strategy (Week 1) gates error handling implementation (Week 10-13)
- Performance targets (Week 2) enable early Pi Zero 2W testing (Week 7+)

**Parallel Track Coordination:**
- Core audio pipeline implementation (Weeks 3-6) concurrent with queue persistence specification (Weeks 4-7)
- Queue implementation (Weeks 8-9) concurrent with error handling refinement (Weeks 7-10)
- Must avoid dependency deadlocks (implementation waiting on spec waiting on implementation)

**Pragmatic Decision Documentation:**
- PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer terminology - document assumption in code comments
- Full vs incremental decode - implement always-incremental, prepare to refactor if needed
- Resampler state management - follow rubato documentation, document edge cases

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 10-13 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Weeks 1-2: Critical specification work** (SPEC018, error strategy, performance targets, SPEC014)
- **Weeks 3-6: Core audio pipeline** (decoder, fader, mixer, timing)
- **Weeks 7-9: Queue persistence** (spec refinement + implementation)
- **Weeks 10-13: Error handling + API** (spec refinement + implementation)
- **Weeks 14-15: Testing and validation** (may extend if issues found)

**Rework Risk:** Moderate (+10-20% contingency for specification-implementation coordination issues)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Critical Risks (ADDRESSED):**
- SPEC018 resolved early (Week 1)
- Error handling strategy specified early (Week 1)
- Performance targets defined early (Week 2)

**Implementation-Specification Coordination Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Specification update invalidates in-flight implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Focus early specifications on critical path items, defer peripheral specs
- **Risk:** Implementation discovers specification inadequacy mid-stream
  - **Mitigation:** Require discipline to pause implementation and resolve specification gap
- **Risk:** Parallel tracks create confusion about current state
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation of which specs are complete vs in-progress

**Deferred Gap Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Queue persistence specification delayed until Week 7, may reveal issues
  - **Impact:** May require refactoring of core audio pipeline if persistence affects design
  - **Mitigation:** Core audio pipeline designed to be loosely coupled from persistence
- **Risk:** Full vs incremental buffer decode decision may prove wrong
  - **Impact:** Memory or latency issues on Pi Zero 2W
  - **Mitigation:** Early performance testing (Week 7+) reveals issues with time to fix

**Residual Risks (LOW-MEDIUM):**
- Some rework possible but limited to non-critical areas
- Risk lower than Approach 1, higher than Approach 2

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-designed
- Critical architectural decisions (state machine, error handling, performance) specified upfront
- Core audio pipeline architecture complete before implementation

**Peripheral Architecture:** Evolves during implementation
- Queue persistence architecture refined mid-stream
- Buffer management architecture pragmatic initially, may refine
- Risk: Early and late components may have different architectural styles

**Mitigation:** Maintain architectural consistency through:
- Regular architecture reviews
- Refactoring passes to align early and late components
- Documentation of architectural principles to guide both spec and implementation

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: MODERATE**

**CLAUDE.md /plan Workflow:**
- Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent (SPEC018, error handling, performance)
- Defers some specification work to parallel track
- Not full compliance but pragmatic balance

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy for critical specifications
- Refines specifications based on implementation experience
- Creates REV### document to record specification evolution

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems"
- Approach 3 addresses likely critical issues (SPEC018, error handling) upfront
- Defers non-critical gaps, reducing risk compared to Approach 1
- May be appropriate if timeline constraints exist but quality still valued

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Timeline constraints exist but complete specification (Approach 2) too slow
- Prior implementation problems were critical gaps (SPEC018, error handling) rather than comprehensive specification lack
- Team has discipline to pause implementation when specification inadequate
- Project management can coordinate parallel specification/implementation tracks
- Moderate risk tolerance (between Approach 1 and Approach 2)

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Team struggles with parallel workstreams
- Prior implementation problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Very low risk tolerance (prefer Approach 2)
- Very high timeline pressure (prefer Approach 1, accept risks)

---

## APPROACH 4: Specification Audit + Targeted Fixes (Minimal)

### Description

Conduct formal, systematic audit of all wkmp-ap specifications, classify gaps by severity, and address only critical/high-severity gaps before implementation.

### Detailed Strategy

**Phase 1: Systematic Specification Audit (Week 1)**

**Audit Methodology:**
1. **Document Review:**
   - Review all Tier 1-4 documents relevant to wkmp-ap
   - Extract all specifications, requirements, design decisions
   - Identify ambiguities, contradictions, missing details

2. **Gap Classification:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Blocks implementation or causes incorrect behavior
     - Example: SPEC018 draft status (crossfade completion)
   - **HIGH:** Significant risk or major rework potential
     - Example: Error handling strategy unspecified
   - **MEDIUM:** Workaround possible but suboptimal
     - Example: Queue persistence timing unclear
   - **LOW:** Cosmetic or documentation-only
     - Example: Terminology inconsistencies

3. **Gap Documentation:**
   - Create structured gap inventory (spreadsheet or markdown table)
   - For each gap:
     - Description
     - Severity classification
     - Impact on implementation
     - Affected components
     - Proposed resolution

4. **Severity Criteria:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Cannot implement without resolution, or implementation will be incorrect
   - **HIGH:** Can implement with workaround, but high rework risk or production risk
   - **MEDIUM:** Can implement with pragmatic decision, low-moderate rework risk
   - **LOW:** Does not affect implementation, documentation/consistency issue only

**Audit Deliverable:** Gap inventory with severity classifications and proposed resolutions

**Phase 2: Gap Resolution (Weeks 2-3)**

**Week 2: CRITICAL Gaps**
- SPEC018 formal review and approval
- Any other critical gaps identified during audit

**Week 3: HIGH Gaps**
- Error handling strategy specification
- Performance targets definition
- SPEC014 update/archive
- Any other high-severity gaps

**Deferred: MEDIUM and LOW Gaps**
- Queue persistence strategy (implement eager persistence as pragmatic choice)
- Buffer decode strategy (implement always-incremental as pragmatic choice)
- Terminology reconciliation (document assumptions in code)
- Resampler state management (follow library documentation)

**Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 4-13)**
- Implement with critical/high gaps resolved
- Make pragmatic decisions on medium/low gaps
- Document deferred gap decisions in code comments
- Prepare to refine if deferred gaps prove important

### Advantages

1. **Focused Effort on Highest-Impact Issues:** Systematic audit ensures critical issues prioritized
2. **Avoids Over-Specification:** Low-priority details remain flexible for implementation adaptation
3. **Faster than Full Specification:** Only 1-3 weeks spec work vs 2-4 weeks for Approach 2
4. **Systematic Gap Identification:** Formal audit reduces "unknown unknowns"
5. **Documented Rationale:** Gap inventory provides traceability for deferred decisions
6. **Audit Artifact Reusable:** Gap inventory useful for future specification refinement

### Disadvantages

1. **Severity Classification Subjective:** May defer actually-important items (classification errors)
2. **Still Requires Significant Analysis:** Audit itself takes 1 week (Week 1)
3. **Deferred Gaps May Cause Problems:** Medium/low gaps may prove more important during implementation
4. **Doesn't Fully Address User's Concern:** If prior implementation had comprehensive specification problems, audit+fixes may be insufficient
5. **Partial /plan Compliance:** Addresses critical gaps but defers others

### Technical Considerations

**Audit Scope:**
- Review all documents identified in Phase 3 (REQ001, REQ002, SPEC002, SPEC007, SPEC011, SPEC013, SPEC014, SPEC016, SPEC017, SPEC018, IMPL001, IMPL002, IMPL003, EXEC001, GUIDE001)
- Approximately 15+ documents, ~10,000+ lines total
- Estimate: 1 week for thorough audit by experienced engineer

**Gap Severity Classification:**

**Predicted CRITICAL Gaps:**
- SPEC018 status unclear (crossfade completion blocker)

**Predicted HIGH Gaps:**
- Error handling strategy unspecified
- Performance targets missing
- SPEC014 vs SPEC016 contradiction

**Predicted MEDIUM Gaps:**
- Queue persistence timing unclear
- Full vs partial buffer strategy unspecified
- Queue-chain reconciliation on restart

**Predicted LOW Gaps:**
- PassageBuffer/ManagedBuffer/DecoderChain terminology
- Resampler state management details (library-specific)

**Pragmatic Decisions for Deferred Gaps:**
- Queue persistence: Implement eager persistence (every operation writes to DB)
- Buffer strategy: Always incremental decode
- Terminology: Use PassageBuffer as primary, document assumptions
- Resampler: Follow rubato documentation, handle edge cases pragmatically

### Effort Estimate

**Total: 11-13 weeks**

Breakdown:
- **Week 1: Systematic audit** (gap inventory with severity classifications)
- **Week 2: CRITICAL gap resolution** (SPEC018 review/approval)
- **Week 3: HIGH gap resolution** (error handling, performance targets, SPEC014)
- **Weeks 4-13: Implementation** (8-10 weeks per GUIDE001, with pragmatic decisions on MEDIUM/LOW gaps)

**Rework Risk:** Moderate (+10-20% contingency if deferred gaps prove important)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Systematic Audit Benefits (REDUCES RISK):**
- Formal gap identification reduces unknown unknowns
- Severity classification ensures critical issues addressed
- Documented gap inventory provides traceability

**Severity Classification Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Classify actually-critical gap as medium/low, defer resolution
  - **Impact:** Implementation blocked or incorrect
  - **Mitigation:** Conservative classification (when in doubt, classify higher)
- **Risk:** Classify actually-low gap as critical, waste specification effort
  - **Impact:** Delays implementation unnecessarily
  - **Mitigation:** Require clear blocker rationale for CRITICAL classification

**Deferred Gap Risks (MEDIUM):**
- **Risk:** Queue persistence strategy (MEDIUM) proves inadequate
  - **Impact:** State inconsistencies, refactoring required
  - **Mitigation:** Eager persistence is safe default, unlikely to be wrong
- **Risk:** Buffer decode strategy (MEDIUM) causes memory or latency issues
  - **Impact:** Performance problems on Pi Zero 2W
  - **Mitigation:** Early performance testing reveals issues with time to fix
- **Risk:** Terminology inconsistencies (LOW) cause implementer confusion
  - **Impact:** Misunderstandings, misimplementation
  - **Mitigation:** Document assumptions clearly in code comments

**Residual Risks (MEDIUM):**
- Depends heavily on quality of severity classification
- If classification is accurate, risk similar to Approach 3
- If classification is poor, risk approaches Approach 1

### Architecture Impact

**Core Architecture:** Well-designed for critical areas
- Critical architectural decisions (crossfade completion, error handling) specified
- Performance architecture designed for constraints

**Peripheral Architecture:** Pragmatic
- Queue persistence architecture pragmatic (eager approach)
- Buffer management architecture pragmatic (incremental decode)
- May not be optimal but functional

**Risk of Architectural Inconsistency:** Medium - critical areas designed, peripheral areas pragmatic

### Alignment with Project

**Alignment: MODERATE**

**CLAUDE.md /plan Workflow:**
- Addresses critical gaps per /plan intent
- Risk-based approach pragmatic for resource-constrained projects
- Audit artifact provides traceability
- Not full compliance but defensible

**WKMP Documentation Framework:**
- Respects 5-tier hierarchy for critical specifications
- Deferred gaps documented in audit artifact
- May create REV### document to record critical gap resolutions

**User Context:**
- User considering "re-write due to problems"
- Approach 4 addresses likely critical issues
- May be insufficient if prior problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Appropriate if prior problems were specific critical gaps

### When to Use This Approach

**Appropriate If:**
- Need systematic gap identification (audit valuable artifact)
- Confident in ability to classify gap severity accurately
- Prior implementation problems were specific critical gaps (not comprehensive specification lack)
- Moderate timeline pressure (11-13 weeks acceptable)
- Moderate risk tolerance

**Less Appropriate If:**
- Severity classification expertise unavailable
- Prior implementation problems were comprehensive specification lack
- Very low risk tolerance (prefer Approach 2)
- Very high timeline pressure (prefer Approach 1, accept higher risks)

### Recommendation

**Given user's context (considering re-write due to implementation problems):**

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Approach 2 (Specification Completion)**
- **Rationale:** Prior implementation problems suggest specification gaps were significant
- **Benefit:** Prevents repeating mistakes
- **Cost:** 2-4 weeks specification work, but reduces overall rework risk significantly
- **Alignment:** Strongly aligns with CLAUDE.md /plan workflow and WKMP documentation rigor

**ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: Approach 3 (Hybrid Phased)**

- **Benefit:** Addresses critical gaps (SPEC018, error handling) early, maintains momentum
- **Cost:** More complex project management, some rework risk
- **Appropriate If:** Timeline cannot accommodate 12-14 weeks but 10-13 weeks acceptable

**NOT RECOMMENDED:**
- **Approach 1:** Risks repeating prior implementation problems
- **Approach 4:** Similar to Approach 3 but less systematic; audit overhead without full benefit

**Decision Factors:**
- If timeline > 12 weeks available: **Approach 2**
- If timeline 10-13 weeks: **Approach 3**
- If timeline < 10 weeks: **Approach 1** with acceptance of risks, or extend timeline

**User retains decision authority based on:**
- Timeline constraints
- Resource availability (specification decision authority)
- Risk tolerance
- Prior implementation problem root cause assessment

## FINDING 1: SPEC018 Status Unclear (CRITICAL BLOCKER)

### Summary

SPEC018 (Crossfade Completion Coordination) identifies critical gap in mixer-to-engine communication but has "Draft → Implementation" status, unclear if solution is approved/implemented.

### Document References

- **[SPEC018-crossfade_completion_coordination.md](../../docs/SPEC018-crossfade_completion_coordination.md)** (lines 1-100)
- Status field (line 6): "Draft → Implementation"

### Problem Description

**Background (SPEC018 lines 49-90):**

Mixer has three states (SPEC002):
1. `None` - No audio playing
2. `SinglePassage` - One passage playing
3. `Crossfading` - Two passages overlapping

**Current behavior:**
- When crossfade completes (fade-out and fade-in both finish), mixer internally transitions from `Crossfading` to `SinglePassage`
- Incoming passage becomes new current passage in mixer's internal state
- **Gap:** Engine never notified of this transition

**Consequence:**
- Engine's `process_queue()` loop uses `mixer.is_current_finished()` to detect passage completion
- During `Crossfading` state, `is_current_finished()` returns `false`
- Engine never knows when outgoing passage finishes
- Engine attempts queue advancement based on wrong state
- Result: Stops and restarts incoming passage (BUG-003)

**SPEC018 Proposed Solution (lines 94-100):**
- Implement explicit crossfade completion signaling from mixer to engine
- Allow queue advancement without interrupting incoming passage

### Gap Details

**What's Missing:**
1. Is SPEC018 solution approved for implementation?
2. Is it already implemented in current codebase?
3. Which specific signaling mechanism should be used?
   - Option A: Mixer returns completion event on each `mix()` call
   - Option B: Mixer emits completion via event bus
   - Option C: Engine polls mixer for completion status
   - Option D: (Other approach)

**Why It's Critical:**
- Cannot implement queue advancement logic without knowing crossfade completion design
- Guessing wrong approach requires significant refactoring
- Queue advancement is core functionality - must work correctly

### Impact Assessment

**Affected Components:**
- `playback/engine.rs` - Queue processing loop
- `playback/pipeline/mixer.rs` - State machine and completion signaling
- `playback/queue_manager.rs` - Queue entry lifecycle

**Blocker Rationale:**
- Implementation of queue advancement logic depends entirely on crossfade completion design
- Cannot proceed with engine implementation without resolution

### Recommended Resolution

1. **Conduct formal review of SPEC018:**
   - Evaluate proposed solution
   - Consider signaling mechanism options
   - Assess impact on architecture

2. **Make decision:**
   - Approve SPEC018 as-is, OR
   - Revise SPEC018 with specific signaling mechanism, OR
   - Reject and propose alternative solution

3. **Update document status:**
   - Change from "Draft → Implementation" to "Approved" with version number
   - If revised, increment version and update content

4. **Verify implementation state:**
   - Check if solution already implemented in current codebase
   - If so, document actual implementation approach
   - If not, implementation can proceed per approved specification

## FINDING 2: Error Handling Strategy Unspecified (HIGH RISK)

### Summary

No comprehensive error handling strategy specified for decode failures, buffer underruns, audio device failures, or queue inconsistencies.

### Document References

No existing document specifies error handling strategy. Gap identified across:
- SPEC016 mentions decode failures (line 80) but doesn't specify handling
- SPEC013, SPEC014 do not address error scenarios
- IMPL001 does not specify error event tables or error state columns

### Error Scenario Inventory

#### 1. Decode Failures

**Scenarios:**
- File corrupted or unreadable (I/O error, permission denied)
- Unsupported codec variant (e.g., non-standard MP3 variant)
- Partial decode (file truncated, download incomplete)
- Decoder library panic (symphonia internal error)
- File format mismatch (database says MP3, actually FLAC)

**Current State:** Unspecified

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
- Should playback skip passage and continue with next?
- Should playback pause and await user intervention?
- Should playback retry decode (how many times)?
- Should event be emitted? Which event type?
- Should error be logged? At what level (error, warning)?
- Should user be notified via UI? Immediately or batched?
- Should passage be marked as "decode failed" in database?

**Typical Industry Approach:**
- Log error at ERROR level with file path and error message
- Emit PassageDecodeFailed event with passage_id and error details
- Remove passage from queue
- Notify user via SSE error event
- Continue with next passage in queue
- Optionally mark passage as problematic in database to prevent re-enqueueing

#### 2. Buffer Underruns

**Scenarios:**
- Decoder too slow to fill buffer before mixer exhausts it
- CPU overload (other processes competing for cycles)
- I/O stall (slow SD card, network drive delay)
- Thread scheduling delays (low-priority thread starved)

**Current State:** Unspecified

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
- Should playback pause immediately?
- Should mixer insert silence to prevent audio artifacts?
- Should playback attempt emergency buffer refill?
- How long to wait for buffer refill before declaring failure?
- Should event be emitted?
- Should user see "buffering" indicator?
- Is underrun recoverable or fatal?

**Typical Industry Approach:**
- Pause playback immediately
- Emit BufferUnderrun event
- Attempt emergency decode of current passage
- If refill succeeds within 2-3 seconds, resume playback
- If refill fails, skip to next passage
- Log warning with buffer state details

#### 3. Audio Device Failures

**Scenarios:**
- Bluetooth headphones disconnected
- HDMI monitor turned off (audio device disappears)
- USB DAC unplugged
- Device becomes unavailable (another app takes exclusive access)
- Device configuration error (unsupported sample rate)
- cpal stream error (platform-specific issues)

**Current State:** Unspecified

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
- Should playback pause and await device reconnection?
- Should playback fallback to different device (e.g., built-in speakers)?
- Should user be prompted to select new device?
- How long to retry reconnection before giving up?
- Should playback state (position, queue) be preserved during device failure?
- Should event be emitted?

**Typical Industry Approach:**
- Pause playback immediately
- Emit AudioDeviceLost event
- Attempt reconnection every 1-2 seconds for up to 30 seconds
- If original device reconnects, resume playback
- If timeout, prompt user to select new device
- If user cancels device selection, remain paused

#### 4. Queue Inconsistencies

**Scenarios:**
- Passage referenced in queue but not in passages table
- File path invalid (file moved, deleted, or renamed)
- Chain assignment impossible (all chains busy, queue depth > maximum_decode_streams)
- Passage timing points invalid (constraints violated)
- Circular queue references (should be impossible but defensive)

**Current State:** Partially specified

**SPEC016 [DBD-LIFECYCLE-050]** addresses chain exhaustion:
- When all maximum_decode_streams chains allocated, newly enqueued passages wait without chains
- "Future enhancement" mentioned for assigning chains when available

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
- Should invalid queue entries be removed automatically?
- Should invalid entries trigger user notification?
- Should queue validation run periodically or only at enqueue time?
- How to handle passage without file (skip or remove from queue)?
- Should database referential integrity constraints prevent these scenarios?

**Typical Industry Approach:**
- Validate queue entries on load from database
- Remove invalid entries automatically
- Log each removal at WARNING level
- Emit QueueValidationError event with details
- Optionally notify user of cleanup actions taken

#### 5. Sample Rate Conversion Errors

**Scenarios:**
- Rubato resampler failure (internal error)
- Invalid source sample rate from decoder (0 Hz, negative, extremely high)
- Resampler state corruption
- Insufficient memory for resampler buffers

**Current State:** Unspecified

**Questions Requiring Answers:**
- Should resampling be bypassed if conversion fails?
- Should passage be skipped?
- How to handle sample rate mismatch if bypass chosen?
- Should event be emitted?

**Typical Industry Approach:**
- If source rate == output rate, bypass resampler (already specified [DBD-RSMP-020])
- If source rate != output rate and resampler fails, skip passage
- Emit ResamplingFailed event
- Log error with source/target rates

### Impact Assessment

**Production Risk:** HIGH
- Without error handling strategy, failures cause crashes or silent failures
- User experience poor (unexplained pauses, skips, crashes)
- Debugging difficult (no events, insufficient logging)
- Recovery impossible (no retry or fallback mechanisms)

**Testing Impact:** Cannot Write Tests
- No error scenarios specified means no error test cases
- Cannot validate error behavior
- Cannot detect error handling regressions

**Implementation Impact:** Ad-hoc Decisions
- Developer forced to make error handling decisions during implementation
- Decisions may not match project conventions or user expectations
- Inconsistent error behavior across different error types

### Recommended Resolution

**Create comprehensive error handling strategy specification:**

1. **Error Taxonomy:**
   - Classify errors by severity: Fatal, Recoverable, Degraded
   - Classify errors by category: Decode, Buffer, Device, Queue, Resampling
   - Define recovery strategies per classification

2. **Per-Error Handling Specification:**
   - For each error scenario (5 categories × ~4 scenarios each = 20 scenarios)
   - Specify: Detection mechanism, immediate action, recovery attempts, failure action
   - Specify: Event emission (type, payload), logging (level, message), user notification

3. **Event Definitions:**
   - Define error-related events to add to WkmpEvent enum (SPEC011)
   - Examples: PassageDecodeFailed, BufferUnderrun, AudioDeviceLost, QueueValidationError, ResamplingFailed

4. **User Notification Strategy:**
   - Which errors trigger immediate notification vs logged-only?
   - How are errors presented in UI (modal, toast, status bar)?
   - How are batched errors presented (e.g., 5 decode failures in a row)?

5. **Logging Requirements:**
   - Define log levels per error type (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
   - Define required log message components (timestamp, component, error details, context)
   - Define structured logging fields for error events

6. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Define fallback behaviors (e.g., device failure → fallback to default device)
   - Define minimal viable functionality (e.g., playback paused but queue preserved)

7. **Integration with SPEC011 Event System:**
   - Update event_system.md to include error events
   - Specify SSE broadcasting of error events
   - Specify event handler requirements for error recovery

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days of specification work

## FINDING 3: SPEC014 vs SPEC016 Decoder Contradiction

### Summary

SPEC014 describes parallel 2-thread decoder pool; SPEC016 specifies serial decode execution. Contradiction may mislead implementers.

### Document References

**SPEC014 (outdated content):**
- Lines 26-106: Detailed description of parallel 2-thread decoder pool
- Lines 94-98: Thread creation, priority queue, shutdown behavior
- Lines 91-93: "Fixed pool: 2 decoder threads" rationale

**SPEC014 (clarification notes):**
- Line 76: "Design evolved to serial decode execution (SPEC016 [DBD-DEC-040])"
- Line 78: "This section describes the original 2-thread pool design"
- Line 85: "New design: Serial decode execution with priority-based switching"

**SPEC016 (authoritative):**
- [DBD-DEC-040]: "serial decoding approach (one decoder at a time) for improved cache coherency"
- [DBD-DEC-050] through [DBD-DEC-080]: Serial decode flow specifications

### Problem Description

**Scenario:**
- Implementer reads GUIDE001 or EXEC001 which references SPEC014
- Implementer reads SPEC014 detailed decoder pool description (lines 26-106)
- Implementer begins implementing 2-thread pool
- Later discovers SPEC016 specifies serial decode
- Realizes wasted effort implementing obsolete design

**Why Notes Insufficient:**
- Notes are mid-document (line 76, line 85)
- Easy to miss if skimming or searching for "decoder" or "thread"
- Detailed parallel design (80 lines) more prominent than brief notes
- No prominent warning at top of document

### Impact Assessment

**Misleading Risk:** MEDIUM
- Implementer may waste 1-3 days implementing parallel pool before discovering obsolescence
- Not critical to correctness (would eventually discover and fix)
- But frustrating and inefficient

**Documentation Clarity:** POOR
- Contradictory content in specification documents undermines trust
- Makes WKMP documentation appear less rigorous than it actually is

### Recommended Resolution

**Option A: Update SPEC014 to Match SPEC016 (Preferred)**

1. Replace parallel decoder pool sections (lines 26-106) with serial decode description matching SPEC016
2. Move parallel decoder pool content to archive (e.g., archive/SPEC014-parallel-decoder-design.md)
3. Add note in SPEC014: "Historical parallel decoder pool design archived; see SPEC016 for current authoritative decoder design"
4. Update SPEC014 to reference SPEC016 for decoder implementation

**Benefits:**
- SPEC014 becomes consistent with SPEC016
- Historical design preserved in archive for reference
- Clear forward reference to authoritative spec

**Effort:** 2-4 hours

**Option B: Add Prominent Warning at Top of SPEC014**

1. Add section at top of document (after metadata, before Overview):
   ```markdown
   ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Decoder Design Superseded

   **The decoder pool design described in this document (parallel 2-thread pool) is OBSOLETE.**

   **Current authoritative decoder design:** See [SPEC016 Decoder Buffer Design](SPEC016-decoder_buffer_design.md) [DBD-DEC-040] for serial decode execution.

   **This document remains for historical reference and contains valuable information on other components (buffer manager, mixer, output). For decoder implementation, use SPEC016.**
   ```

2. Add similar warning before "1. Decoder Thread Pool" section (line 26)

**Benefits:**
- Minimal effort
- Preserves full historical context
- Clear warning prevents confusion

**Effort:** 30 minutes

**Option C: Archive SPEC014, Forward to SPEC016**

1. Move SPEC014 to archive
2. Create stub SPEC014 that forwards to SPEC016, SPEC013
3. Update references in other documents

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates contradiction entirely
- Forces use of current specifications

**Drawbacks:**
- Loses other valuable content in SPEC014 (buffer manager, mixer descriptions)
- More disruptive to documentation structure

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (Prominent Warning)**
- Lowest effort
- Preserves content
- Prevents confusion
- Can upgrade to Option A later if desired

## FINDING 4: Performance Targets Unspecified

### Summary

No quantified performance specifications despite targeting Raspberry Pi Zero 2W deployment.

### Document References

**Pi Zero 2W Reference:**
- SPEC014 [SSD-DEC-030]: "Raspberry Pi Zero2W resource limits (REQ-TECH-011)"
- REQ001 references Pi Zero 2W as target platform

**Hardware Constraints:**
- **CPU:** 1 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 (ARMv8)
- **RAM:** 512 MB
- **Storage:** Typically SD card (10-20 MB/s read speed)
- **Architecture:** 64-bit ARM

### Missing Specifications

#### 1. Decode Latency Targets

**What Should Be Specified:**
- Time to fill 15-second buffer (playout_ringbuffer_size = 661941 samples @ 44.1kHz)
- Target: Buffer fills in <1000ms? <500ms?
- Maximum acceptable latency before playback starts
- Recovery time after buffer underrun

**Why It Matters:**
- User experience (how long after hitting play does music start?)
- Queue refill responsiveness (how quickly can next passage be readied?)
- Crossfade quality (buffer must fill before lead-out point or crossfade fails)

**Typical Targets (Desktop):**
- Immediate playback: Buffer fills in <200ms
- Normal playback: Buffer fills in <500ms
- Acceptable: Buffer fills in <1000ms
- Poor: Buffer fills in >1000ms

**Pi Zero 2W Expectations:**
- Likely 2-3x slower than desktop due to ARM CPU and SD card I/O
- Reasonable target: Buffer fills in <1500ms for 44.1kHz FLAC
- Conservative target: Buffer fills in <2000ms

#### 2. CPU Usage Targets

**What Should Be Specified:**
- Maximum acceptable CPU percentage during playback
- Per-core or aggregate?
- Average vs peak?

**Why It Matters:**
- Pi Zero 2W has limited CPU headroom
- Must leave CPU available for UI, API, other modules
- High CPU usage may cause thermal throttling
- Affects feasibility of running multiple WKMP modules on same Pi

**Typical Targets (Desktop):**
- Idle playback (no decode): <5% CPU
- Active decode: <20% CPU average, <40% peak
- Crossfade: <30% CPU average, <50% peak

**Pi Zero 2W Expectations:**
- Single-core performance lower than desktop
- Quad-core available but most audio code single-threaded
- Reasonable target: <50% average, <80% peak (single core)
- Conservative target: <60% average, <90% peak

#### 3. Memory Usage Targets

**What Should Be Specified:**
- Maximum total application memory usage
- Breakdown by component (buffers, decoder state, API, etc.)

**Why It Matters:**
- Pi Zero 2W has only 512 MB total RAM
- Must share with OS, other modules, browser if UI accessed locally
- Memory exhaustion causes OOM killer, crashes
- SPEC016 calculates 60 MB for 12 buffers but is that total app usage?

**Current State:**
- SPEC016 [DBD-PARAM-070]: playout_ringbuffer_size = 661941 samples (15.01s)
- Per buffer: 661941 samples × 2 channels × 4 bytes/f32 = 5,295,528 bytes ≈ 5.3 MB
- 12 buffers (maximum_decode_streams): 12 × 5.3 MB = 63.6 MB for PCM buffers
- Plus decoder state, resampler state, queue, API, event bus, etc.

**Typical Targets (Desktop):**
- Lightweight media player: <100 MB
- Full-featured media player: <200 MB
- Heavy media player: <500 MB

**Pi Zero 2W Expectations:**
- Must be lightweight given 512 MB total RAM
- Reasonable target: Total app <150 MB
- Conservative target: Total app <200 MB
- Critical if exceeded: >250 MB (risk of OOM)

#### 4. Throughput Targets

**What Should Be Specified:**
- How many passages can be decoded per minute?
- Queue refill rate (passages/second)
- Minimum acceptable program director selection speed

**Why It Matters:**
- If decoder is too slow, queue empties faster than it refills
- Program director may select passages faster than decoder can prepare them
- User manually enqueueing multiple passages may experience delays

**Calculation Example:**
- Average passage length: 3 minutes = 180 seconds
- Average file size: 5 MB (FLAC) or 3 MB (MP3)
- Decode time per passage: ?
- If decode time > average passage length, queue will eventually empty

**Typical Desktop Performance:**
- FLAC decode: ~10-20x real-time (decode 3-minute file in 9-18 seconds)
- MP3 decode: ~30-50x real-time (decode 3-minute file in 3-6 seconds)

**Pi Zero 2W Expectations:**
- Likely 3-5x slower than desktop
- FLAC: ~3-6x real-time (decode 3-minute file in 30-60 seconds)
- MP3: ~10-15x real-time (decode 3-minute file in 12-18 seconds)
- Reasonable target: Decode 1 passage per minute
- Sufficient if queue depth ≥ 3 and passage length ≥ 3 minutes

#### 5. API Response Time Targets

**What Should Be Specified:**
- Maximum acceptable response time for control endpoints
- Percentile targets (p50, p95, p99)

**Why It Matters:**
- User experience (UI responsiveness)
- Mobile app tolerance for high latency low
- SSE client timeout considerations

**Typical Targets:**
- Simple GET requests (status, queue): <10ms p50, <30ms p95
- POST requests (enqueue, skip): <50ms p50, <100ms p95
- Complex operations: <200ms p50, <500ms p95

**Pi Zero 2W Expectations:**
- Similar to desktop (API logic simple, not CPU-bound)
- Reasonable target: <50ms p50, <150ms p95

### Impact Assessment

**Cannot Validate Success:** HIGH IMPACT
- Without targets, cannot determine if implementation succeeds
- Cannot perform acceptance testing
- Cannot detect performance regressions
- Cannot validate Pi Zero 2W deployment feasibility

**Development Guidance:** MEDIUM IMPACT
- Developers don't know what's acceptable
- May over-optimize (waste time) or under-optimize (poor performance)

**User Expectations:** MEDIUM IMPACT
- Cannot set user expectations (how fast will this be?)
- Cannot make deployment hardware recommendations

### Recommended Resolution

**Create performance target specification:**

1. **Research Pi Zero 2W Capabilities:**
   - Review existing audio applications on Pi Zero 2W
   - Benchmark symphonia/rubato on ARM architecture
   - Understand SD card I/O characteristics

2. **Define Quantified Targets:**
   - Decode latency: <1500ms for 15s buffer fill (44.1kHz FLAC)
   - CPU usage: <50% average, <80% peak (single core)
   - Memory usage: <150 MB total application
   - Throughput: ≥1 passage decoded per minute
   - API response: <50ms p50, <150ms p95

3. **Create Performance Test Specifications:**
   - Define test scenarios (decode 100 passages, measure time)
   - Define measurement methodologies (CPU profiling tools, memory tracking)
   - Define acceptance criteria (must meet targets on 90% of test runs)

4. **Document Targets in SPEC016 or New SPEC###:**
   - Add "Performance Targets" section to SPEC016
   - Or create new SPEC### document for performance specifications

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (1 day research, 1 day target definition, 0.5 days test spec, 0.5 days documentation)

## FINDING 5: Queue Persistence Strategy Unclear

### Summary

Database schema defines queue table; runtime uses HashMap for chain assignments. When/how is state persisted? How is consistency maintained across restarts?

### Document References

**Database Schema (IMPL001):**
- Queue table defined with columns: guid, passage_guid, user_guid, play_order, enqueued_at, etc.
- Foreign key constraints to passages table

**Runtime State (SPEC016):**
- [DBD-LIFECYCLE-040]: "PlaybackEngine maintains HashMap<QueueEntryId, ChainIndex> for passage→chain mapping"
- Chain assignments persist throughout passage lifecycle

### Gap Details

**Question 1: When is queue persisted to database?**

Options:
- **Eager Persistence:** Every enqueue/dequeue operation writes to database immediately
  - Pros: Strong consistency, simple recovery on restart
  - Cons: Higher I/O overhead (SD card wear on Pi Zero 2W)
- **Lazy Persistence:** Periodic writes (e.g., every 5 seconds)
  - Pros: Reduced I/O overhead
  - Cons: Risk of losing queue state if crash occurs between writes
- **Shutdown Persistence:** Only on graceful shutdown
  - Pros: Minimal I/O overhead
  - Cons: Queue state lost on crash or power failure

**Question 2: How is chain assignment state reconciled on restart?**

Scenarios:
- **Clean shutdown:**
  - Queue persisted to database
  - On restart, load queue from database
  - Rebuild chain assignments based on queue position?
  - Or are chain assignments also persisted?

- **Crash recovery:**
  - Queue may be stale (if lazy or shutdown persistence used)
  - Chain assignments definitely lost (HashMap in memory)
  - How to rebuild chain assignments?
  - Which passages get chains first (position in queue)?

**Question 3: Are chain assignments persisted?**

Options:
- **Not persisted:** Chain assignments are runtime-only
  - On restart, rebuild based on queue position (first N passages get chains)
  - Simple, no database changes needed
- **Persisted:** Add chain_index column to queue table
  - Persist chain assignments to database
  - On restart, restore exact chain assignments
  - Complex, but preserves more state

**Question 4: What if database queue and runtime queue diverge?**

Scenarios:
- Manual database edit while wkmp-ap running
- Database corruption
- Bug in persistence logic

### Impact Assessment

**Restart Behavior:** MEDIUM IMPACT
- Unclear how queue is restored on restart
- May cause user confusion (queue order changed? passages disappeared?)

**State Consistency:** MEDIUM IMPACT
- Divergence between database and runtime state possible
- May cause bugs (queue entry in DB but not in runtime, or vice versa)

**I/O Performance:** LOW IMPACT
- Eager persistence vs lazy persistence affects SD card wear
- But likely minor compared to audio file reads

### Recommended Resolution

**Specify queue persistence strategy:**

1. **Choose Persistence Timing:**
   - **RECOMMENDATION: Eager Persistence**
   - Rationale: Simple, strong consistency, minimal risk of state loss
   - Implementation: Every enqueue/dequeue/reorder operation writes to database
   - Acceptable I/O overhead (queue operations infrequent compared to audio reads)

2. **Specify Restart Reconciliation:**
   - On startup:
     1. Load queue entries from database (ORDER BY play_order ASC)
     2. Validate each entry (passage exists, file exists, timing points valid)
     3. Remove invalid entries (log warning for each)
     4. Rebuild chain assignments: First `maximum_decode_streams` passages get chains
     5. Emit QueueRestored event with entry count
   - Chain assignments NOT persisted (runtime-only)

3. **Specify Consistency Guarantees:**
   - Database is source of truth for queue contents and order
   - Runtime HashMap is source of truth for chain assignments
   - On divergence detection (should not happen), log error and force reload from database

4. **Update IMPL001 and SPEC016:**
   - Add persistence timing specification to IMPL001
   - Add reconciliation logic to SPEC016 or SPEC013

**Estimated Effort:** 4-8 hours (specification + documentation update)

## FINDING 6: Full vs Partial Buffer Strategy Unspecified

### Summary

SPEC016 references "full/partial buffer strategy" but doesn't specify decision logic for when to fully decode vs incrementally decode passages.

### Document References

**SPEC016:**
- Line 62 mentions "Full/partial buffer strategy"
- [DBD-PARAM-070]: playout_ringbuffer_size = 661941 samples (15.01s @ 44.1kHz)
- Incremental decode behavior implied (pause when full, resume when space) but not explicitly specified

**SPEC014:**
- References buffer management but doesn't detail full vs partial decision

### Gap Details

**Question: When to fully decode passage vs incremental decode?**

**Option A: Always Incremental**
- Decode all passages incrementally
- Pause decode when buffer reaches playout_ringbuffer_size
- Resume decode when buffer space available (mixer has consumed samples)
- Pros: Consistent behavior, simple logic, memory-efficient
- Cons: May add latency for short passages that could fit in memory entirely

**Option B: Full for Short, Incremental for Long**
- If passage duration < playout_ringbuffer_size (15s), decode fully into buffer
- If passage duration ≥ playout_ringbuffer_size, decode incrementally
- Pros: Short passages fully buffered (faster startup), long passages memory-efficient
- Cons: More complex logic, two code paths to maintain

**Option C: Based on Queue Depth**
- If passage is currently playing or next: Full decode (priority)
- If passage is prefetch (position ≥ 2): Incremental decode
- Pros: Prioritizes playback immediacy
- Cons: Complex, may not save memory (next passage may be long)

**Option D: Full Always (if memory allows)**
- Decode all passages fully into memory
- Allocate dynamic buffer size based on passage duration
- Pros: Simplest for decoder (just decode entire passage)
- Cons: High memory usage (12 passages × average duration could exceed RAM on Pi Zero 2W)

### Impact Assessment

**Memory Efficiency:** MEDIUM IMPACT
- Full decode of 12 long passages could use excessive memory on Pi Zero 2W
- Incremental decode always safe but may add complexity

**Startup Latency:** LOW IMPACT
- Full decode of first passage faster than incremental (no pause/resume cycles)
- But difference likely <1 second, acceptable

**Code Complexity:** LOW IMPACT
- Incremental decode requires pause/resume logic but well within rubato/symphonia capabilities
- Full decode simpler but memory management more complex

### Recommended Resolution

**Specify buffer decode strategy:**

1. **RECOMMENDATION: Always Incremental (Option A)**
   - Simplest, most predictable
   - Memory-safe for all passage lengths
   - Consistent behavior
   - Pause/resume logic required but straightforward

2. **Specification Details:**
   - Decoder decodes passage from start to end
   - Writes decoded PCM to PassageBuffer until buffer full (reached playout_ringbuffer_size)
   - Pauses decode (stores decoder state)
   - Resumes when buffer space available (check every output_refill_period, default 10ms)
   - Repeats until passage end reached

3. **Edge Case: Passage Shorter than Buffer**
   - If passage duration < playout_ringbuffer_size, decode completes in single pass
   - Buffer never reaches full state
   - Effectively equivalent to full decode for short passages

4. **Update SPEC016:**
   - Add section "Buffer Fill Strategy" with incremental decode specification
   - Remove "full/partial buffer strategy" mention or clarify as "always incremental"

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours (specification + documentation)

---

## FINDING 7: Resampler State Management Details Unspecified

### Summary

SPEC016 references StatefulResampler but doesn't specify state initialization, flush behavior, or edge case handling.

### Document References

**SPEC016:**
- [DBD-RSMP-010]: "rubato StatefulResampler maintains resampling state across chunk boundaries"
- [DBD-RSMP-020]: "Bypass when source_rate == working_sample_rate"
- [DBD-RSMP-030]: Integrated into decoder chain

### Gap Details

**Question 1: State Initialization**
- How is StatefulResampler initialized? (call to `new()` with what parameters?)
- When is state reset? (per passage? reused across passages if same sample rate?)

**Question 2: Flush Behavior**
- When passage end reached, how to flush resampler internal buffers?
- Resampler may have buffered samples not yet output
- Without flush, tail samples lost (click/pop at passage end)

**Question 3: Edge Cases**
- What if sample rate changes mid-file? (unlikely but technically possible)
- What if sample rate is unsupported (e.g., 12345 Hz)?
- What if resampler returns error?

### Impact Assessment

**Implementation Clarity:** LOW IMPACT
- These are implementation details likely covered in rubato library documentation
- Experienced developer can infer from library API
- Not architectural decisions

**Correctness:** LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT
- Flush behavior important to avoid tail sample loss
- But likely discoverable during testing (audible click at passage end)

### Recommended Resolution

**Option A: Specify Resampler Usage (Comprehensive)**
- Add detailed rubato StatefulResampler usage specification to SPEC016
- Cover initialization, flush, edge cases
- Effort: 4-6 hours (research rubato API, write spec)

**Option B: Defer to Library Documentation (Minimal)**
- Add note to SPEC016: "Resampler state management follows rubato StatefulResampler API documentation"
- Specify only critical behavior (bypass if source == working rate, flush on passage end)
- Effort: 1-2 hours

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (Defer to Library)**
- Rubato documentation is comprehensive
- Not WKMP-specific architectural decision
- Reduces specification maintenance burden (rubato API may change)
- Add note to SPEC016 referencing rubato documentation

## FINDING 8: Terminology Inconsistencies (PassageBuffer / ManagedBuffer / DecoderChain)

### Summary

SPEC016 references PassageBuffer, ManagedBuffer, and DecoderChain but relationship between these types is unclear.

### Document References

**SPEC016:**
- Line 112: "decoder-buffer chain (design concept) = PassageBuffer (core data structure) wrapped in ManagedBuffer (lifecycle management)"
- [DBD-OV-040]: Diagram shows DecoderChain
- Text uses all three terms somewhat interchangeably

**SPEC014:**
- Line 131: `PassageBuffer` struct definition
- No mention of ManagedBuffer or DecoderChain

### Gap Details

**Unclear Relationships:**
- Is ManagedBuffer a separate type or just conceptual description?
- Is DecoderChain a type or just diagram label?
- Which type is used at which API boundary?

**Possible Interpretations:**

**Interpretation A:**
- `PassageBuffer` = Core struct holding PCM data
- `ManagedBuffer` = Wrapper adding lifecycle (allocation, release) - separate type
- `DecoderChain` = Full pipeline (Decoder → Resampler → Fader → PassageBuffer) - separate type
- Three distinct types

**Interpretation B:**
- `PassageBuffer` = Core struct
- `ManagedBuffer` = Conceptual term (not actual type), just describes PassageBuffer lifecycle
- `DecoderChain` = Conceptual term for entire pipeline
- One type (PassageBuffer), two conceptual terms

**Interpretation C:**
- `DecoderChain` = Actual struct encapsulating entire pipeline
- `PassageBuffer` = Component within DecoderChain
- `ManagedBuffer` = Another component or wrapper
- Multiple types with hierarchical relationship

### Impact Assessment

**Implementation Clarity:** LOW IMPACT
- Unclear naming but doesn't block implementation
- Developer will choose naming scheme and proceed
- May not match SPEC intent but functionally equivalent

**Code Readability:** LOW IMPACT
- Inconsistent naming across codebase
- But can be refactored later without affecting behavior

### Recommended Resolution

**Clarify and document type relationships:**

1. **Define Types Explicitly in SPEC016:**
   - If three distinct types, provide struct definitions
   - If conceptual terms, clearly label as such
   - Example clarification:
     ```markdown
     **Type Definitions:**
     - `PassageBuffer` (struct): Core PCM buffer, fade application, position tracking
     - `DecoderChain` (struct): Encapsulates Decoder → Resampler → Fader → PassageBuffer pipeline
     - "Managed buffer" (conceptual): Refers to PassageBuffer lifecycle managed by BufferManager
       - Not a separate type
       - Just describes how PassageBuffer is allocated/released
     ```

2. **Update SPEC016 Line 112:**
   - Replace ambiguous description with explicit type definitions

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours
