# Crossfade Integration Tests

This document describes the automated integration tests for the crossfade mixer, which validate the enhanced features developed during audible testing.

## Purpose

These tests extract the key validation techniques from the audible crossfade test (`audible_crossfade_test.rs`) and make them part of the regular test suite. This ensures that the quality metrics and timing accuracy requirements are continuously validated without requiring manual listening tests.

## Test Coverage

### 1. `test_fade_in_timing_accuracy`
**Purpose:** Validates that fade-in completes at the expected time with correct RMS progression

**Validates:**
- Fade-in duration accuracy (2 seconds)
- RMS level increases proportionally during linear fade-in
- Final RMS reaches expected amplitude (~0.56 for 0.8 amplitude sine wave)

**Requirements:** SSD-XFD-020 (fade-in timing)

### 2. `test_crossfade_timing_accuracy`
**Purpose:** Validates proper overlap and timing during crossfade between two passages

**Validates:**
- Crossfade duration accuracy (3 seconds)
- RMS remains relatively stable during crossfade (constant power)
- Smooth transition from one passage to another

**Requirements:** SSD-XFD-030 (crossfade overlap timing)

### 3. `test_fade_out_to_silence`
**Purpose:** Validates fade-out to silence produces clean termination

**Validates:**
- RMS decreases during fade-out period
- Final RMS approaches zero (< 0.001)
- Logarithmic fade-out curve produces smooth decay

**Requirements:** SSD-XFD-040 (fade-out timing)

**Note:** This test addresses the issue found in the original audible test where the final passage was cut off abruptly at full volume.

### 4. `test_clipping_detection`
**Purpose:** Validates that mixer properly handles high-amplitude signals

**Validates:**
- Amplitude clamping prevents values exceeding 1.0
- High amplitude crossfades approach but don't exceed clipping threshold
- Frame clamping implementation works correctly

**Requirements:** SSD-MIX-060 (output level management)

### 5. `test_multiple_crossfades_sequence`
**Purpose:** Validates that multiple consecutive crossfades maintain quality

**Validates:**
- Three passages with different fade curves all produce stable RMS
- RMS values remain consistent across all passages (within 20% tolerance)
- Different fade curve combinations work correctly

**Requirements:** SSD-MIX-040 (state machine transitions)

### 6. `test_rms_tracker_accuracy`
**Purpose:** Validates the RMS calculation algorithm itself

**Validates:**
- Silent signal produces RMS = 0
- Constant amplitude signal produces RMS ≈ amplitude
- Full-scale sine wave produces RMS ≈ 0.707 (1/√2)

**Note:** This test validates the measurement tool itself to ensure other tests are reliable.

### 7. `test_timing_tolerance_calculation`
**Purpose:** Validates timing tolerance checking logic

**Validates:**
- Timing difference calculations
- 500ms tolerance threshold enforcement
- Edge cases (exactly at tolerance boundary)

## RMS Level Tracking

All tests use the `AudioLevelTracker` struct which implements a rolling window RMS calculator:

```rust
struct AudioLevelTracker {
    samples: Vec<f32>,      // Rolling window of samples
    window_size: usize,     // Window size in samples
}
```

**Window sizes used:**
- 100ms window (4410 samples) for fade-in/crossfade stability checks
- 50ms window (2205 samples) for fade-out decay monitoring

**RMS calculation:**
```
RMS = sqrt(sum(sample²) / sample_count)
```

## Test Data Generation

Tests use synthetic audio buffers with known characteristics:

**Sine wave buffers:**
```rust
create_sine_buffer(frequency: f32, duration: f32, amplitude: f32)
```
- Generates pure sine wave at specified frequency
- Allows precise RMS predictions
- Used frequencies: 220Hz, 440Hz, 880Hz

**Silent buffers:**
```rust
create_silent_buffer(duration: f32)
```
- All-zero samples
- Used for fade-out to silence testing

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all crossfade integration tests
cargo test --test crossfade_integration_tests

# Run specific test
cargo test --test crossfade_integration_tests test_fade_in_timing_accuracy

# Run with output
cargo test --test crossfade_integration_tests -- --nocapture
```

## Test Performance

All 7 tests complete in approximately **0.3 seconds**, making them suitable for regular CI/CD pipelines.

## Relationship to Audible Test

The audible crossfade test (`audible_crossfade_test.rs`) remains valuable for:
- Subjective quality assessment by human listeners
- Detection of artifacts not captured by RMS measurements
- Verification with real MP3 files from the music library
- End-to-end validation of the complete audio pipeline

The integration tests complement the audible test by providing:
- Automated regression testing
- Precise timing validation
- Quantitative quality metrics
- Fast feedback during development

## Known Limitations

1. **Synthetic signals only:** Tests use generated sine waves, not real music
2. **No frequency analysis:** Tests only measure RMS, not spectral characteristics
3. **No artifact detection:** Cannot detect clicks, pops, or phase issues
4. **Single sample rate:** All tests use 44.1kHz only

For comprehensive quality assurance, both automated tests and audible testing should be performed.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the test suite:
1. Variable sample rate testing (48kHz, 96kHz)
2. Multi-channel testing (mono, 5.1, 7.1)
3. Frequency domain analysis (FFT-based artifact detection)
4. Phase coherence testing
5. Dynamic range testing
6. Stress testing (rapid skip sequences, simultaneous crossfades)
