Bug report:

Manual testing of current version of wkmp-ap found the following incorrect behavior consistently.

Actions to reproduce:

cd wkmp-ap
cargo run

Via the localhost:5721 developer UI, enqueue three regular .mp3 audio files each approximately 2-3 minutes in length.

Expected behavior:

All three audio files (now passages) should play in their entirety.

Actual behavior:

First two passages play, usually in their entirety, but the third file only plays 15 seconds, then stops.

debug_log_2025-10-20T143035.txt contains console output from one test.
