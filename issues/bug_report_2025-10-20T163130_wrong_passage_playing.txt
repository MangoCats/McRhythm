Bug report:

Manual testing of current version of wkmp-ap found the following incorrect behavior.

Actions to reproduce:

cd wkmp-ap
cargo run

Via the localhost:5721 developer UI, enqueue three regular .mp3 audio files each approximately 2-3 minutes in length.

Expected behavior:

All three audio files (now passages) should play in their entirety.

Actual behavior:

First passage started playing, but aborted early and the second passage started to play.  The Queue Contents display
did not update, still showing all three passages until the second passage completed its first play-through.  At the
end of the first playing of the second passage, the second passage started again and the Queue Contents updated to
show only passages 2 and 3 remaining to play.  At the end of the second passage's second play-through, normal behavior
returned, passage 3 played in its entirety then stopped as expected.

 contains console output from one test.
