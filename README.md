# WKMP
Auto DJ for playing your music library

## Overview

WKMP is a music player that plays locally stored audio files to local audio output devices.  Passages from the audio files are automatically selected to play based on user-configured musical flavor preferences using AcousticBrainz musical characterization data and other algorithms.

The system can work as a simple music file player, or build up to a hourly, daily, weekly, annually programed music source inspired by FM radio stations of the 1970s.

Built with Rust, GStreamer and SQLite.

Third-party news aggregation APIs

These are the most suitable option for comprehensive local coverage because they pull from a vast network of sources, including local affiliates and online publications.
- NewsData.io: Integrates content from thousands of trusted news sources and can be filtered by country (e.g., US), language, keyword, and more. You can access real-time and historical data through a simple JSON format.
- News API: A popular choice that indexes articles from over 80,000 worldwide sources. It supports location-based filtering, provides articles in JSON format, and is well-documented.
- World News API: Offers access to news from thousands of sources and can be filtered by country or region, as well as by language and category. It provides a free tier for low-volume personal projects.
