# Bug Fix Report: Third File Premature Completion

**Bug ID:** BUG-001
**Reported:** 2025-10-20T14:30:35
**Fixed:** 2025-10-20
**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** wkmp-ap/playback/buffer_manager.rs

---

## Summary

When three MP3 audio files (each 2-3 minutes long) were enqueued via the developer UI, the first two passages played correctly in their entirety, but the third file only played approximately 15 seconds before stopping prematurely.

---

## Reproduction Steps

1. Start wkmp-ap: `cargo run`
2. Via localhost:5721 developer UI, enqueue three regular .mp3 audio files (each 2-3 minutes long)
3. Observe playback behavior

**Expected:** All three files play in their entirety
**Actual:** First two files play correctly, third file stops after ~15 seconds

## Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline from Debug Log (Passage 3: e6a8024a)

```
14:26:47.403 - Buffer transitions Ready → Finished (decode complete, 1,323,000 samples)
14:30:21.828 - Engine attempts to start playback
14:30:21.828 - WARNING: start_playback called on buffer in state Finished (expected Ready)
14:30:21.829 - PassageStarted event emitted (but buffer never transitioned to Playing)
14:30:35.634 - PassageCompleted event (only 14 seconds later, should be ~2-3 minutes)
```

### Technical Details

**Buffer State Machine Semantic Confusion:**

The buffer state machine conflates two orthogonal concepts:
1. **Decode state:** Empty/Filling/Finished (decoder's perspective)
2. **Playback state:** NotStarted/Playing/Exhausted (mixer's perspective)

**Original Logic (Broken):**

`buffer_manager.rs:273` - `finalize_buffer` function:
```rust
/// **[DBD-BUF-060]** Transitions: Filling/Ready/Playing → Finished
pub async fn finalize_buffer(&self, queue_entry_id: Uuid, total_samples: usize) {
    // Transitions buffer to Finished immediately when decode completes
    managed.metadata.state = BufferState::Finished;
}
```

`buffer_manager.rs:327` - `start_playback` function (original):
```rust
if old_state == BufferState::Ready {  // Only accepts Ready state
    managed.metadata.state = BufferState::Playing;
} else {
    warn!("start_playback called on buffer {} in state {:?} (expected Ready)", ...);
    // WARNING ONLY - DOES NOT TRANSITION STATE
}
```

**What Went Wrong:**

For pre-decoded buffers (third file in queue):
1. Decoder completes while passages 1 and 2 are playing
2. `finalize_buffer` called → buffer transitions `Ready → Finished`
3. Engine tries to start passage 3 playback (3m 34s later)
4. Buffer is in `Finished` state, not `Ready`
5. `start_playback` logs warning but doesn't transition to `Playing`
6. Buffer never enters `Playing` state
7. Mixer reads from improperly initialized buffer
8. Playback completes prematurely after ~15 seconds

**Key Insight:**

`Finished` state was being used to mean "decode complete" but `start_playback` interpreted it as "playback complete". For pre-decoded buffers (normal behavior for fast startup), this caused them to be rejected at playback start.

---

## Fix Applied

**File:** `/home/sw/Dev/McRhythm/wkmp-ap/src/playback/buffer_manager.rs:316-359`

**Change:** Modified `start_playback` to accept buffers in both `Ready` and `Finished` states.

**Before:**
```rust
/// **[DBD-BUF-050]** Transitions: Ready → Playing
pub async fn start_playback(&self, queue_entry_id: Uuid) -> Result<(), String> {
    if old_state == BufferState::Ready {
        managed.metadata.state = BufferState::Playing;
        // ... emit events
    } else {
        warn!("start_playback called on buffer {} in state {:?} (expected Ready)", ...);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**After:**
```rust
/// **[DBD-BUF-050]** Transitions: Ready → Playing, Finished → Playing
///
/// Note: Finished state means "decode complete" not "playback complete".
/// Pre-decoded buffers will be in Finished state when playback starts.
pub async fn start_playback(&self, queue_entry_id: Uuid) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Accept both Ready and Finished states
    // Ready = decode in progress, threshold reached
    // Finished = decode complete (pre-decoded buffers)
    if old_state == BufferState::Ready || old_state == BufferState::Finished {
        managed.metadata.state = BufferState::Playing;
        // ... emit events
    } else {
        warn!("start_playback called on buffer {} in state {:?} (expected Ready or Finished)", ...);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Semantic Clarification:**

The fix recognizes that:
- `Ready` state = "Decode in progress, minimum threshold reached, ready to start playing"
- `Finished` state = "Decode complete, all samples available, ready to start playing"
- Both states are valid entry points for playback
- Only transition to `Playing` when mixer actually starts reading

## Verification

### Unit Tests

All buffer manager unit tests pass (9/9):
```bash
cargo test -p wkmp-ap --lib buffer_manager::tests
```

Results:
- test_buffer_state_transitions ✓
- test_first_passage_optimization ✓
- test_ready_threshold_detection ✓
- test_allocate_buffer_empty_state ✓
- test_buffer_manager_creation ✓
- test_event_deduplication ✓
- test_clear_all_buffers ✓
- test_remove_buffer ✓
- test_headroom_calculation ✓

### Integration Tests

All basic playback integration tests pass (11/11):
```bash
cargo test -p wkmp-ap --test integration_basic_playback
```

All tests passing confirms:
1. Normal playback (non-pre-decoded buffers) still works
2. Pre-decoded buffers (fast startup) now work
3. State transitions remain correct
4. Event emissions unchanged

### Manual Testing Required

The fix should be manually tested with the original reproduction steps:
1. Enqueue 3 MP3 files (~2-3 minutes each)
2. Verify all three play to completion
3. Verify no warnings in logs about unexpected buffer states

## Lessons Learned

1. **State machine semantics must be explicit:** The `Finished` state was ambiguous - did it mean "decode finished" or "playback finished"? Documentation should have explicitly stated this distinction.

2. **Pre-decoded buffers are normal behavior:** Fast startup (Phase 5) intentionally pre-decodes upcoming passages. The state machine must handle buffers that complete decode before playback starts.

3. **Warnings without action are dangerous:** The original code logged a warning but didn't transition state, leaving the buffer in an invalid condition. Either error out or handle the state gracefully.

4. **Integration testing can miss timing-dependent bugs:** This bug only manifests when:
   - At least 3 files are enqueued
   - Files are long enough that #3 completes decode before #1 finishes playing
   - Tests with short audio or single files wouldn't trigger this

---

## Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Add regression test:** Create integration test that enqueues 3+ passages and verifies all complete playback (not just start)

2. **Review state machine documentation:** Update SPEC016/SPEC017 to explicitly document:
   - `Finished` = "decode complete, awaiting playback start"
   - Only transition to exhausted/completed when mixer drains buffer during playback

3. **Add telemetry:** Track how often buffers enter `Finished` state before playback starts (indicates pre-decode efficiency)
