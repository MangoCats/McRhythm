## Implementation Readiness

### Database Migration (T1-TIMING-001 APPROVED)

**Status:** ✅ DOCUMENTED AND APPROVED

**Implementation Plan:** See `/home/sw/Dev/McRhythm/docs/validation/T1-TIMING-001-APPROVED.md`

**Changes Required:**
1. Database migration script (REAL → INTEGER ticks)
2. API conversion layer (milliseconds ↔ ticks, formula: ms * 28,224)
3. Playback engine updates (15 files, 500-800 LOC)
4. Crossfade timing calculations in ticks

**Effort:** 7-10 developer days
**Risk:** MEDIUM (comprehensive testing required, rollback plan documented)

### Code Verification Needed

**IMPL-001:** Serial Decode Migration (3-5 days)
- Current implementation: 2-thread decode pool
- Target implementation: Serial execution with priority-based switching
- Files affected: decoder_pool.rs, buffer_manager.rs, playback_controller.rs

**IMPL-003:** Fade Timing Verification (0.5-2 days)
- Verify fade curves applied before buffering (not during read_sample)
- Verify implementation matches SPEC016 [DBD-FADE-030], [DBD-FADE-040], [DBD-FADE-050]
