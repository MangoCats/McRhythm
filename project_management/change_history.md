# WKMP Change History

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit trail of all project changes
**Maintained by:** /commit workflow (automated)
**Format:** Reverse chronological (newest first)

---

## Instructions

This file is automatically maintained by the `/commit` workflow. Each commit appends:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- Commit hash (added one commit later via one-commit-lag system)
- Summary of changes (effects, objectives, key modifications)

**Do NOT manually edit this file.** Use `/commit` for all commits to maintain consistency.
