# WKMP Change History

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit trail of all project changes
**Maintained by:** /commit workflow (automated)
**Format:** Reverse chronological (newest first)

## Instructions

This file is automatically maintained by the `/commit` workflow. Each commit appends:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- Commit hash (added one commit later via one-commit-lag system)
- Summary of changes (effects, objectives, key modifications)

**Do NOT manually edit this file.** Use `/commit` for all commits to maintain consistency.

**Complete Phase 7 error handling implementation (PLAN001)**

**Summary:**
Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation for WKMP audio player. All errors handled via skip-and-continue pattern with real-time SSE event notifications and structured logging.

**Requirements Implemented:** 10/10 core error handling requirements
- Decode errors (file read, unsupported codecs, partial decode, panic recovery)
- Buffer underrun detection and emergency refill
- Queue validation at enqueue time
- Resampling initialization and runtime error handling
- Position drift detection (three-tier severity)
- File handle exhaustion detection (platform-specific)

**Graceful Degradation Verified:**
- Queue integrity preservation
- Position preservation (no resets)
- User control availability (pause/skip/volume)

**Event & Logging Verified:**
- 12/12 error types emit appropriate events
- All events include complete debugging context
- Appropriate severity levels for all errors
- Structured logging with context

**Test Coverage:** 58 tests with 100% pass rate
- 34 unit tests (decode errors, queue validation, resampling, error injection framework)
- 24 integration tests (end-to-end error handling, graceful degradation, queue integrity)

**Files Added:**
- Planning: 7 documents (progress tracking, requirements, verification)
- Test specifications: 6 documents (test index, traceability matrix, 4 test cases)
- Test infrastructure: error_injection.rs (360 lines)
- Test suites: error_handling_unit_tests.rs (477 lines), error_handling_integration_tests.rs (367 lines)

**Deferred:** 3 requirements (14 hours) - device error handling and full OOM implementation

**Impact:**
- System reliability: All file/codec errors handled gracefully (no crashes)
- User experience: Real-time error notifications, maintained control during errors
- Debugging: Comprehensive structured logging
- Time efficiency: 21 hours actual vs 43 hours estimated (51% under)
